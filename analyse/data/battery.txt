VFirst of all good service from Amazon.in, timely delivery before the expected date. Coming to the product, this is my first DSLR and I have researched online for at least 3 months before getting into a conclusion. It is by far the best among the beginners level DSLR in the 25-45k range. Got confused whether to buy Nikon D3300 or Nikon D5200 but chose this one due to better ISO and faster processor and newer version. I am using this camera since almost 2 months now and after using this I am shocked how can a beginners DSLR give performance like this.Before heading into the review, I would like to mention the contents of the box.\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bfIN THE BOX:\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf Nikon D3300 Body, with body cap.\u29bf Nikkor AF-S 18-55 mm f/3.5-5.6 VR II Kit Lens.\u29bf EN-EL14a Li-ion Battery, with a terminal cover.\u29bf MH-24 Battery Charger.\u29bf UC-E17 Data Transfer USB Cable.\u29bf EG-CP14 AV cable.\u29bf Nikon Strap.\u29bf View NX2 CD-ROM.\u29bf User Manual.\u29bf Warranty Card x 2  1. Two years Warranty Card with the serial Number of the Camera  2. One year International Warranty Card with the serial number of the lens  [Note: Though the two warranty cards comes with either one of the serial numbers, that does not mean it is only applicable to the lens or  camera only, both the warranty cards are applicable to both camera body and lens. Another thing the other accessories are not covered  under any warranty]\u29bf 8 GB SD Card (Taped outside the box)\u29bf Nikon DSLR Camera Bag\u29bf Two Nikon School CDs and one invitation. (Received it as a offer, may not be applicable in your case)[Note the camera does not come with an Accessory Hot-Shoe Cover, unlike other models, so you have to buy it separately, if you need to protect your hot-shoe, it costs around 35 INR in normal camera shop.]\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714PROS:\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714 The Sensor: Well o well, the 24 MP sensor that you get in this camera is the same one as that of the Nikon D7100 and Nikon D5300 which speaks much of the picture quality you are going to get with this camera. The sensor has a total pixel density of 24.78 pixels, which result in images having much details, while sacrificing the low light performance a bit.\u2714 The camera comes with a faster and more improved processor, the Expeed 4 Processing Engine which lets the camera to process images and especially videos faster than the older models. This is the main reason why the camera's got faster frame rates than the predecessors.\u2714 The camera does not come with OLPF(Optical Low Pass Filter) which results in significantly sharper images. Nikon is doing a new upgrade in their cameras nowadays i.e, they are removing the Low Pass Filter, so as a result, the camera can now capture both types of light i.e, with shorter wavelength and longer wavelength which ultimately makes the images much more sharper.\u2714 The camera has a 11 point focus system, which is awesome for a camera at this price tag. You get a single cross type focus point in the middle and other 10 normal focus points surrounding the frame. This 11 focus points can do a fast auto focus while paired up with a good lens and it also has 3D tracking functionality. This 11 points are also very helpful and fast responsive during manual focusing.\u2714 The ISO performance is very good for a beginner's DSLR at 12800 and a boost ISO of 25600. More importantly this camera has low noise at 1385 ISO which is awesome. But try to avoid ISO more than 3200 until it is a pitch black scene, because that would produce much noise in the images.\u2714 The battery backup is also great, 700 shots is very much unexpected from a camera of this configuration but Nikon seems to have got it right. The EN-EL14a battery is an upgraded version of the EN-EL14 battery which used to come with the Nikon D3200 and it has increased mAh and efficient power handling.\u2714 The kit lens is very good and it has a much faster auto-focus than the predecessor and is also much compact and lighter. Most importantly the lens comes with VR II motor, which is very useful for a beginner having problems to hold the camera still at earlier stages of photography. It keeps that 52 mm filter thread so no worries for ones who have 52 mm filter from your old lenses, you can use them on this.\u2714 1080p 60fps, now this is a big deal, even some of the advanced DSLRs can't go that far but this does. Very helpful if you need to shoot action. I have been shooting fast action videos with lag free performance at 1080p 60 fps, thanks to the faster new Expeed 4 processor, which has a super fast processing speed.\u2714 You get 5fps 24.0MP RAW files which is awesome but you need a good and faster card for that the offered card can't keep up with that speed. Well a good recommendation and in fact the best card will be SanDisk Extreme Pro, it offers fantastic write speed of 72.8mbps for this camera and the buffer never clicks in if you shoot at burst mode using this card, just you have to keep in mind that the shutter needs to be pressed after every 100 shots to continue burst shooting.\u2714 The camera has a good colour depth of 24.3 bits which produces vivid colours on the images and you can see the effect of those 24.3 bits during post processing.\u2714 The camera comes with a 3 inch 921k dots LCD display, which may not be the best monitor in the world, but certainly it is bright enough and produces vivid colours close to real world view.\u2714 Easy Panaroma mode -  Now it is like a bonus though you hardly need it, but handy at times. Remember you are capturing a panaroma from a DSLR so the picture would be much much better than what you may take with phones.\u2714 Very compact camera. It does not seem like a DSLR if you hold it in your palm, it is so compact and light. The camera only weighs about 450 g (without the battery), which is super light when you are talking about a DSLR of this performance.\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718CONS:\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718 The ISO can be used at one full stop, so you can't get the 1/3rd or 1/2nd stop ISO at manual mode, but you get that in auto mode, that is may be something Nikon has not made due to simplicity for beginners, but that is not so great a deal due to good ISO performance of this camera.\u2718 The camera can shoot only 12 bit RAW files, unlike 14 bits in the Nikon D5xxx series, which although produces great image quality, but that extra elegance goes somewhere missing. Though you can hardly notice that until you shoot it at 14 bits RAW and compare the two.\u2718 No articulating screen, this is something that would have been better to have for shooting at tricky situations, but that also would have raised the price. But personally I did not give that much priority. Also in professional DSLRs you hardly get that articulating screen.That said the cons are not that big deal considering the price of this camera and that it is build focusing mostly for the beginners.\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8VERDICT:\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8Overall a wonderful camera to be owned. The camera bag offered is also fair enough. Many of us think that camera does the job, if we have good camera we can get good images but that is not the thing, a photographer makes the photograph unique not the camera. Yes, there are some limitations but still that is not that important for good shots. This camera just has more features compared to counterparts from Canon or Sony, or any other company at the same price point but that is not a great deal for photography, this is just a bit advanced. Well I have attached some shots taken with the camera and the camera itself. Thank you for reading this much. I will update the review after more usage in depth. Please hit Yes if you found my review helpful, if not then you can comment on the review with your issue and I will definitely help you. Happy Shopping!!!

VNikon has released a new kit lens in 2016 that is compatible with D3300. There are various kit lenses before it. This is what you need to understand :AF- S 18-55mm VR - oldestAF- S 18-55mm VR II - oldAF- P 18-55mm VR- latestThe "P" stands for a stepping motor, a newer technology which makes the lens significantly quieter (almost silent) and slightly faster. The new lens has also slightly better performance at wide open settings. And it has VR- Vibration Reduction for image stabilization. You can read the Ken Rockwell review of this lens.I've seen many people being angry at the seller for sending them the AF-P VR lens which is the latest, complaining that they did not get the VR II lens. You should be actually thanking them for sending you the latest lens and not the old one.The new Kit lens requires a firmware update for Nikon D3300( V1.01). But the orders placed now and afterwards will receive cameras with the latest firmware inbuilt.About the camera, you know its the best. Splendid image quality equivalent to higher end Nikon DX cameras. So even if you buy the D7200, there wouldn't be a big difference in image quality. The controls n features change.Reasons why you might want to consider Canon 1200D(1300D has no worthy improvement) :1) You want DSLR quality photos. Nikon just does it better. But Canon's still a DSLR with a big sensor. Great photos there too.2) If you don't shoot RAW or if you don't post process your photos, get the Canon. (This is where Nikon's sensor really shines, at getting the fine details back)3) You will get the 2 lens option with Canon under 23K (on good seasons) and that second lens is a  55-250mm IS II. A very good telephoto lens. So if you're not going to buy another lens at all, Canon has a better deal.4) Canon lenses are usually cheaper. Like the 50mm f1.8 portrait lens. Nikon cost 10,000 INR while Canon's variant is around or below 8000 INR.5)Canon has a very cheap wide lens, the 10-18mm. Nikon doesn't !Canon Cons :1) No amazing sensor. Canon's sensor is smaller in size too. Hence less efficient. But still capable of DSLR quality images. Nikon takes better shots under low light.2) Not for video lovers. No mic jack on Canon. Does not do 60fps which is required for slow mo. Nikon has a mic jack for clear external audio and it does 60fps too.3) Nikon is smaller and lighter.4) Battery. Nikon has double the battery capability compared to Canon.Both have no touch screen nor a screen that tilts. The Kit lens that comes with Nikon is significantly better than Canon's. So it takes great pictures. Sample shots can be seen at Pixelpeeper or Flickr.And yes, the kits lens can blur the background at 55mm f5.6.Lenses to buy afterwards, if you're serious about photography :1) Nikon AF P 70-300 VR. Stabilized lens for 14-15k is a great deal. Autofocus is really fast but the aperture at 300mm is 6.3. So it would struggle a bit under low light situations. A major wildlife photographer needs something like the Tamron 150-600mm lens.2) Nikon 35mm f1.8G. An all around amazing lens. This lens makes you a better photographer. Fixed prime, meaning no zoom. But unmatched image quality at this price. Great for indoor shots too.3) A wide angle lens. Expensive Tokina 11-16mm.4) If portraits are a big deal to you, only then go for the 50mm f1.8 G.Overall an amazing camera. You cannot go wrong with this one. Just make sure you really need a DSLR and its features. If you're someone who needs better images than smartphones with a good flash, better portability and going to shoot in Auto Mode anyway, you're looking for a point and shoot camera and the new ones takes great pictures under good light.

VGeneral Observations about Amazon, packaging & warrantyProduct ordered on 15th Oct --- Delivered on 29th Oct....!!!Packaging was very good.No dealer stamp on warranty and Bill doesnt contain product number which may be a problem for warranty, have to clarify with amazon regarding this, Before purchase i asked them about warranty and they have assured if u buy from Amazon fulfilled supplier amazon will give warranty even if nikon does not gives thats when i decided to buy online since it was 6k cheaper than authorized dealers which will save u money to buy an extra lens!!!Now about the Nikon masterpiece D3300Before buying any expensive product online it is mandatory for us all to do a research about the competetion and available products within our budget. Please compare the available products in ur price range only like u can not compare D3300 with a DSLR costing 55K...It will come down to Canon 1200D with zoom lens kit, D3200, D5200 and Canon 600D.All between 26-32k range. Nikon D3100 & Canon 1100D etc are old models and are still cheaper so i didnt considered them.Being a first DSLR hands down almost 99% of google recommemds D3300. I went to Nikon and Canon dealers and checked all models in this budget. heres why i went for D3300 & the after experience :1) It offers u latest processor and sensor with VR-II kit lens.2) The Battery Life is Best in its class with remarkable nos ahead from the competetion and i felt the same after using it.3) Its really very handy and small compared to D5200, only thing 5200 has a tilt screen but i felt it will not make that much difference, for fitting a tilt screen the size of the camera becomes large. I read a lot since my final two models were 5200 and 3300 and felt that the latest processor and better battery life and a diff of 6k for D3300 will be good for my requirements. Since nowhere u can find exceptional difference between image quality of the two cameras. HDR u will hardly require and tilt screen for me was not a priority.4) The image quality is superb. it has a child mode which is very useful when u dont have time for manual settings. Auto mode produces fine images when u dont have time for settings.5) Comes with 8GB card which will be sufficient for few months till u conquer all skills of photography.6) Bag is ok but not very stylish. Can accomodate an extra lens easily.7) Camera is very very fast, first time users will fall in love with the speed of the camera absolutely no lags anywhere.8) Photograps in low light and indoor pics at evening or night time are also very impressive. Flash does an excellent job.9) Colour reproduction is superb, if u click vegetables and look on HDTV they look way better than they look in real life :)...10) I was not used to click pics through view finder so i thought live view is a very useful feature for a DSLR but in real life u will  hardly use live view once u get ur hands on unless a position where u cant put ur head below the cam, even with specks it is  very easy to shoot using view finder .11) LCD screen is very good. With high resolution screen u can judge the quality of image immediatly after clicking which is difficult if  the LCD resolution is low.12) Nikon website is very informative and helps a lot u can register for nikon school and refer tutorials.13) Canon 1200D with Kit lens & zoom lens is a very tough competetion since Nikon D3300 with similar zoom lens is 10K more but  after a lot of reading from websites and reviews u will find that for image quality nikon is a clear winner at entry level DSLR by a  far margin. Kit lens will fulfil most of ur photography requirements initially, wait till u discover urself what lens u really require  before going on to purchase the combo pack with zoom lens.  Hence i decided to buy D3300 and leave the zoom lens in to be bought further category.14) It takes a little time for autofocus at night in very low light but it is ok otherwise autofocus in all other conditions is excellent.  captures fast moving objects in the frame perfectly.15) Manual supplied in the box is useful, and should be read first if u r using a DSLR for the first time.16) It has a wifi feature which may b useful for clicking pics using ur smart phone but requires u to purchase a dongle.It feels excellent to click from this cam because of its fine ergonomics, small size and light weight. its a worth investment. Its a long road in learning and mastering the techniques in photography, with nikon u will enjoy learing it coz when u do it right it delivers excellent results.... just remember a quote which i like very much :""" Buying a Nikon doesnt makes u a photographer... it only makes u the owner of the Nikon Camera..."""So keep learning....
