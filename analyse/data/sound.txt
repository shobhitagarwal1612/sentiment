VBought this after months of researches and finally proud to say that this is the best..Its a great camera indeed and best among others even better in comparison with some upper class in range.Although there is huge comparisons between these two giants canon and nikon, both are equally good.its totally your choice.Nikon d3300 seems good to me and I'm great with this.Also its not the gear only but also the photographer who takes the shot,so Believe in yourself...Image quality is great..built quality is great, feels compact in hand, smaller and compact as compare to others in range..600d seems bulky in hand..kit lens is indeed good and can serve nearly all purposes and its the best if you're just starting with photography, although for best quality, opt for dedicated lenses.like prime for portraits, telephoto for wildlife etc..lacks OLPS-Optical Low Pass Filter, which I thought as a disadvantage but it turns out as an advantage as it improves image quality, sharpness.professional level dslr have this feature..battery life is near 700 shots per charge with normal shooting..ISO is pretty high, better low light image quality..speed, performance, features are good..in camera editing and raw processor is great, easy to use functions..modes are good and there is guide mode for super easy shooting, but manual mode is the key to outstanding shots, if mastered..lacks articulating screen and WIFI and stereo sound recording for better sound quality..although best entry level dslr..A must buyand for best quality shoot in RAW..
