First the display is big and awesome, the touch is even better than other samsung phones and can be comparable to samsung s6 and far better than micromax and etc. I bought the phone 2 months ago and it got fell down 3 times since then but it is working as good as new. The 3000mah battery is really awesome no heating issue at all, playing asphalt 8 for 2 hrs and it gives me 24 hr full backup on single charge, yes i used it for 24 hrs(Day+ Night)  on single charge while on a vacation. Dont worry about the 1.5 gb ram trust me it works better than micromax phone having 2 gb ram. My phone never hang at all although i'm a heavy gamer playing asphalt8 all day. And the camera is just awesome both the front and rear. I'm uploading a photo i have clicked on my phone camera.",

I bought mine from Samsung retail store so I cannot talk about amazon service for this product.The only problem with J7 is that it does not feature Corning Gorilla glass. But if you get a tampered glass, the phone's screen will be protected from dust and scratches. If you need gorilla glass protection, you might want to buy J7 prime. It has all the features of J7 2015 model except AMOLED display which I think is far better than IPS display in terms of color depth and brightness of the screen.When it comes to gaming performance, this phone is the beast. You can play almost all games on the play store without any lag whatsoever. I have tested following games on my phone with maximum possible graphics settings- NOVA 3, GTA San Andreas, Gangster Vegas, Modern Combat 5.Battery backup on this phone is also very impressive. Once fully charged, you can use it for almost two days with normal use (wifi turned on, phone calls (~2 hours a day), music (~1 hour a day).If you are looking for a budget phone with all the essential features, Galaxy J7 is the right phone for you.",

The only drawback i found is its low speaker volume,, but that did not bother me because there is a workaround to increase its volume.. Samsung really working hard to make its touchwiz snappier and this time,, they managed it to be more snappier than pure android. Gaming performance is awesome.. Display is awesome.. I did not liked the earphones.. So i ordered another earphone to use with this.. RAM is less but performance is far better than higher RAM models.. I compared it with moto x play and overall j7 is clear winner.Android 5.1 out of the box. Battery life is awesome compared to rebranded phones in market and no heating issues which is the most common problem in xiomi, yureka, lenovo.. Belive me guys i bought this phone after a lot of reasearch and i bought this phone to give me peace of mind.. I did not wanted my phone to get heat up  everytime i use it for 5 minutes. .Thank you samsung for this great phone and amazon for great offer.Pardon typos...",

I bought mine from Samsung retail store so I cannot talk about amazon service for this product.The only problem with J7 is that it does not feature Corning Gorilla glass. But if you get a tampered glass, the phone's screen will be protected from dust and scratches. If you need gorilla glass protection, you might want to buy J7 prime. It has all the features of J7 2015 model except AMOLED display which I think is far better than IPS display in terms of color depth and brightness of the screen.When it comes to gaming performance, this phone is the beast. You can play almost all games on the play store without any lag whatsoever. I have tested following games on my phone with maximum possible graphics settings- NOVA 3, GTA San Andreas, Gangster Vegas, Modern Combat 5.Battery backup on this phone is also very impressive. Once fully charged, you can use it for almost two days with normal use (wifi turned on, phone calls (~2 hours a day), music (~1 hour a day).If you are looking for a budget phone with all the essential features, Galaxy J7 is the right phone for you.",

I am a hard user of mobile with whole day WiFi use and 20-25 calls. Charging full in morning leaves me with around 45% battery at 10.00 p.m.The display is crisp and bright. Camera is not excellent but very good. Features like smart manager and otg support makes it a good deal. Coupled with extended storage, dual sim, 4g LTE,  it is a steal at this price. Though the Ram is only 1.5 gb still I have never seen this phone lagging. Finally the after sale customer service is very good courtesy to large offline dealership of Samsung. I highly recommend this phone.",

The only drawback i found is its low speaker volume,, but that did not bother me because there is a workaround to increase its volume.. Samsung really working hard to make its touchwiz snappier and this time,, they managed it to be more snappier than pure android. Gaming performance is awesome.. Display is awesome.. I did not liked the earphones.. So i ordered another earphone to use with this.. RAM is less but performance is far better than higher RAM models.. I compared it with moto x play and overall j7 is clear winner.Android 5.1 out of the box. Battery life is awesome compared to rebranded phones in market and no heating issues which is the most common problem in xiomi, yureka, lenovo.. Belive me guys i bought this phone after a lot of reasearch and i bought this phone to give me peace of mind.. I did not wanted my phone to get heat up  everytime i use it for 5 minutes. .Thank you samsung for this great phone and amazon for great offer.Pardon typos...",
