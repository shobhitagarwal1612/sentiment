This is true but it has a selfie flash (the phone screen shines light on your face before clicking the photo) and I have tried phones with both flash and I realized that selfie flash is better. It is used on the iPhone 6 as well... when you use a led flash on some phones, The brightness is too much and it causes the picture to look unrealistic and extra bright. But the light on the selfie flash is convenient and moderate and it brings out crisp and clear photos that look realistic.In Low light the pictures are quite impressive.Battery: Users are saying the phone has poor battery life. This is also untrue, before the first use you have to switch the phone off and charge the phone till it reaches 100% before using it (It is even written in the user manual to charge it before first use) otherwise if you boot the phone directly for the first time after buying it and start using it right away.. the battery performance will be reduced.Battery life: when phone is fully charged, On minimal usage (only 4g browsing and calls) my battery lasts for at least 36 hours and with heavy usage it lasts for minimum 12 hours+Screenshot: I read a review saying it doesn't take screenshots! Oh my goodness such ignorance!! Hold the power button and home button for 3 seconds to take a screenshot. Simple as ABCNo Super Amoled: This is true which makes it difficult to use the screen outdoors under the sun however the display is still very good and clear. (Samsung always has good display) The phone has an outdoor mode which brightens the screen and you can use the phone perfectly.And one last thing, some of these people giving negative reviews may not even have the phone. They might just be writing based on what they've heard from others. Some know nothing about phones and are just writing crap.The phone is excellent. Branded phone is called branded phone for a reason. You buy them and use them for such a long time... just buy it and enjoy the satisfaction of owning a branded phone.Samsung has really done well by giving reasonable features at this price.Some of those China phones don't last long and have lots of problems later in the long run.Besides Samsung gives one year warranty with this phone.So I would advise you to go for this phone if you have 14k to spare.Otherwise if you your expectations are high but your budget is less then go for a China phone.Please indicate if you found this review useful or not.

            "review_text": "Guys, I have got hands on experience with the phone and used it for a week's time.So, lets directly come to the review,--------------------------------------------------------------- Inside the Box :--> Samsung Galaxy On8 smartphone in Golden color> 2-pin charger (5V-1.55A)> Micro USB cable> Earphones with microphone> 3300mAh battery> User manual and warranty informationDisplay :--Rectifying its past mistake, Samsung has finally offered a Full HD Super AMOLED display for Galaxy On8 with 5.5-inch.Compared to its predecessor On7 with TFT display, the Galaxy On8 jumps comfortably to the next level with pretty impressive screen contributing a good color reproduction, sharpness, viewing angles and an above average sunlight readability. Being equipped with Super AMOLED display, the power consumption will be quite efficient.The display does attract fingerprints leaving smudges on screen sometimes, even though it shouldn\u2019t be a big issue.Moreover, you can choose any one among the four screen modes \u2014 Adaptive display, AMOLED cinema, AMOLED photo, and Basic. To give a heads-up, the \u2018Adaptive display\u2019 optimizes the color range, saturation, and sharpness automatically according to your environment.Design :--While Samsung aces in design language on higher end smartphones, the mid-ranger rarely proves to be good. Talking about the form factor, the device measures 76\u00d7151.7\u00d77.8mm thick and weigh around 169 grams, which is again a slight difference from its predecessor.Moving on to the design, the Galaxy On8 is a doppelganger of Galaxy J7 with very few changes. This 5.5-inch smartphone fits perfectly in hand and isn\u2019t slippery either, offering a nice grip when holding. Moreover, the company has replaced the leather back cover with a polycarbonate material with a smooth matte finish which looks and feels good.The sides of Galaxy On8 has a shiny chrome rim running around with round corners seen in Galaxy J7 previously. On the front top, there is a 5MP front camera with a f/1.9 aperture along with LED flash for low-light selfies. It also has a proximity sensor, ambient sensor next to ear piece. Besides, it\u2019s disappointing that the smartphone lacks notification light, which is present in almost all mid-range smartphones nowadays.On the whole, the build quality and design language is definitely an improvement over its predecessor. The Samsung Galaxy On8 comes Black, Gold and White colors.Apps and Storage :--Speaking of bloatware, the Samsung Galaxy On8 comes with pre-installed with Google, Microsoft office apps, and other native utility apps as well. Moreover, it doesn\u2019t have any game and a dedicated music player as well. In this case, we opted Google Play for listening to music.All things considered, the audio output on speaker turns out to be poor, yet the sound through headphones are decent. Even there are chances of missing out call in a very noisy environment unless if you choose vibration. This device does come with FM radio with a very simple interface.On the ROM, out of 16GB, the user will get around 13.1GB storage. If you need more storage, you can also add microSD card up to 128GBConnectivity and Dual SIM :--The Samsung Galaxy On8 supports connectivity options including 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS and NFC. Nowadays, dual SIM slots are mandatory in the mid-ranger and Galaxy On8 neatly ticks the box here. It also has VoLTE (voice-over-LTE) support for Reliance Jio.Both the SIM slots support 4G LTE and dual standby mode, which in turn allows us to take calls from second SIM even if you are on a call from first SIM. It also has USB on-the-go (OTG) support so that you can connect OTG drives easily. In addition, we also tested the call reception and was pretty satisfied with the experience we got.Performance and storage :--The Octa-Core Exynos 7580 processor clocked at 1.6GHz combined with 3GB RAM provides a butter smooth performance without any noticeable lag or hang. The Samsung Galaxy On8 is definitely fast enough for daily usage and multitasking applications. At this price range, the phone has enough power to offer sufficient performance in the everyday task.Battery :--The Samsung Galaxy On8 is powered by a 3300mAh battery without any quick charging technology. With average usage including calls, browsing Wi-Fi, video calls the smartphone is good for one full day.It also comes with Ultra power saver mode, which saves juices by applying a greyscale theme to your home screen and limiting the number of usable apps. Also, you can replace the battery very easily as it comes with the removable battery options.In our battery test the Galaxy On8 achieved a One Charge Rating of 13 hours and 44 minutes, better than the Galaxy On7 that scored a One Charge Rating of 12 hours and 42 minutes.Camera :--The Samsung Galaxy On8 comes with 13MP rear camera with f/1.9 aperture, and 5MP front camera with single LED flash on both sides.The user interface of the camera is the app is simple without any complications and similar to other Samsung smartphones.It comes with varieties of options including \u2014 mode (Auto, Pro, Panorama, Continuous shot HDR (Rich tone), Night, Beauty face, sports and sound shots), effects negative, sepia, grayscale), timer, picture size, and settings.This smartphone lets you launch the camera app by just pressing the home button twice and use the volume rockers as a camera shutter. To our surprise, the day light shots and macro shots are impressive with fine amount of details and sharpness. The 5MP front camera also proves to be good under perfect day light conditions.But when it comes to low light, the noises are almost present in all areas with loss of details. When turned on the flash under low light, the detailing of subject is decent without light over powering itConclusion :--On the whole, the Samsung Galaxy On8 is definitely an improvement over it predecessor On7 with few refinements that doesn\u2019t go above and beyond. Even though it doesn\u2019t have creative ingredients, it does fares in most of the part when it comes to the mid-range segment.The Galaxy On8 definitely benefits from the design, display, and front facing LED flash which is the most noticeable feature here. Lack of fingerprint sensor, notification LED, and other such options make us turn our head away from Galaxy On8. To sum it up, the Samsung Galaxy On8 is a pretty neat package at Rs. 15,990, until you take a look at other alternatives/rivals.Lets see its Pros & Cons,Pros :--> Good display> Front selfie flash> Dual SIM slots with 4G LTE support> Decent Battery backupCons :--> Lacks fingerprint sensor> Low loudspeaker output> No fast charging support========================================================You can buy this phone at discount from here :-- http://amzn.to/2nP1ltF========================================================Hope this review is helpful for you all,Please appreciate my review by hitting \"Helpful Vote\" button.",

            "review_text": "3. The RAM is of 3 GB which is more than enough for multitasking without any lags.4. Previous Samsung camera has never been disappointing and so as this one as well. For the primary it has a 13 megapixel sensor which takes very good quality images. It comes with an array of features like animated photo, anti-fog, continuous shot, HDR (high dynamic range), auto beauty face, panorama, sports and pro.5. Apart from the primary one the secondary camera is also very very good in low light conditions because of the larger f/1.9 focal aperture. It also has a LED flash on the front panel which can capture selfies even in absolute darkness.6. It comes with a dedicated memory card slot which can expand its memory up to 128 GB with a microSD card.7. The operating system is the latest version of Android Marshmallow and on top of that it comes with a smooth Samsung TouchWiz user interface.8. The body material is made out of metal which is very premium and also the overall thickness is of only 7.8 mm. So from the design standpoint its without a compromise.9. The 3300 mAh battery is large enough to last throughout the day even for an avid user. However gamers might need to recharge more than once during a day.10. Yes, it also supports USB OTG cable for connecting flash drives (pen drives).11. Does it supports Reliance Jio 4G? Yup, it works with Reliance Jio internet. Also it has VoLTE (voice over LTE networks).12. And the last pros is the dedicate navigational touch buttons which are placed below the screen.Reasons Not to Buy Samsung Galaxy On8 (Cons, Demerits or Negatives):1. The internal memory is of only 16 GB which is too less for a 16k priced smartphone. Moreover in actual only 10 GB out of the 16 GB is left for the user.2. Next Galaxy On8 cons or demerits is that there is no NFC (near field communication).3. Also the Gyroscope sensor is missing which is very important for playing AR (augmented reality) games like Pokemon Go and others.4. For a smartphone this expensive it should have come with a fingerprint sensor.5. There is no LED notification light as well which is a cons.6. It does not have a USB Type-C reversible connector.7. Next Samsung Galaxy On8 cons is that infrared sensor for IR blaster is also absent.8. There is no fast charging technology for the 3300 mAh battery.9. And the last Galaxy On8 cons is the absence of a display protection like Corning Gorilla Glass 3 or Asahi Dragontrail glass.My Verdict:  If you can compromise the cons then its still a great phone. But in case if you cannot compromise then go for better alternatives like Lenovo Vibe K5 Note",

This is true but it has a selfie flash (the phone screen shines light on your face before clicking the photo) and I have tried phones with both flash and I realized that selfie flash is better. It is used on the iPhone 6 as well... when you use a led flash on some phones, The brightness is too much and it causes the picture to look unrealistic and extra bright. But the light on the selfie flash is convenient and moderate and it brings out crisp and clear photos that look realistic.In Low light the pictures are quite impressive.Battery: Users are saying the phone has poor battery life. This is also untrue, before the first use you have to switch the phone off and charge the phone till it reaches 100% before using it (It is even written in the user manual to charge it before first use) otherwise if you boot the phone directly for the first time after buying it and start using it right away.. the battery performance will be reduced.Battery life: when phone is fully charged, On minimal usage (only 4g browsing and calls) my battery lasts for at least 36 hours and with heavy usage it lasts for minimum 12 hours+Screenshot: I read a review saying it doesn't take screenshots! Oh my goodness such ignorance!! Hold the power button and home button for 3 seconds to take a screenshot. Simple as ABCNo Super Amoled: This is true which makes it difficult to use the screen outdoors under the sun however the display is still very good and clear. (Samsung always has good display) The phone has an outdoor mode which brightens the screen and you can use the phone perfectly.And one last thing, some of these people giving negative reviews may not even have the phone. They might just be writing based on what they've heard from others. Some know nothing about phones and are just writing crap.The phone is excellent. Branded phone is called branded phone for a reason. You buy them and use them for such a long time... just buy it and enjoy the satisfaction of owning a branded phone.Samsung has really done well by giving reasonable features at this price.Some of those China phones don't last long and have lots of problems later in the long run.Besides Samsung gives one year warranty with this phone.So I would advise you to go for this phone if you have 14k to spare.Otherwise if you your expectations are high but your budget is less then go for a China phone.Please indicate if you found this review useful or not.

            "review_text": "Guys, I have got hands on experience with the phone and used it for a week's time.So, lets directly come to the review,--------------------------------------------------------------- Inside the Box :--> Samsung Galaxy On8 smartphone in Golden color> 2-pin charger (5V-1.55A)> Micro USB cable> Earphones with microphone> 3300mAh battery> User manual and warranty informationDisplay :--Rectifying its past mistake, Samsung has finally offered a Full HD Super AMOLED display for Galaxy On8 with 5.5-inch.Compared to its predecessor On7 with TFT display, the Galaxy On8 jumps comfortably to the next level with pretty impressive screen contributing a good color reproduction, sharpness, viewing angles and an above average sunlight readability. Being equipped with Super AMOLED display, the power consumption will be quite efficient.The display does attract fingerprints leaving smudges on screen sometimes, even though it shouldn\u2019t be a big issue.Moreover, you can choose any one among the four screen modes \u2014 Adaptive display, AMOLED cinema, AMOLED photo, and Basic. To give a heads-up, the \u2018Adaptive display\u2019 optimizes the color range, saturation, and sharpness automatically according to your environment.Design :--While Samsung aces in design language on higher end smartphones, the mid-ranger rarely proves to be good. Talking about the form factor, the device measures 76\u00d7151.7\u00d77.8mm thick and weigh around 169 grams, which is again a slight difference from its predecessor.Moving on to the design, the Galaxy On8 is a doppelganger of Galaxy J7 with very few changes. This 5.5-inch smartphone fits perfectly in hand and isn\u2019t slippery either, offering a nice grip when holding. Moreover, the company has replaced the leather back cover with a polycarbonate material with a smooth matte finish which looks and feels good.The sides of Galaxy On8 has a shiny chrome rim running around with round corners seen in Galaxy J7 previously. On the front top, there is a 5MP front camera with a f/1.9 aperture along with LED flash for low-light selfies. It also has a proximity sensor, ambient sensor next to ear piece. Besides, it\u2019s disappointing that the smartphone lacks notification light, which is present in almost all mid-range smartphones nowadays.On the whole, the build quality and design language is definitely an improvement over its predecessor. The Samsung Galaxy On8 comes Black, Gold and White colors.Apps and Storage :--Speaking of bloatware, the Samsung Galaxy On8 comes with pre-installed with Google, Microsoft office apps, and other native utility apps as well. Moreover, it doesn\u2019t have any game and a dedicated music player as well. In this case, we opted Google Play for listening to music.All things considered, the audio output on speaker turns out to be poor, yet the sound through headphones are decent. Even there are chances of missing out call in a very noisy environment unless if you choose vibration. This device does come with FM radio with a very simple interface.On the ROM, out of 16GB, the user will get around 13.1GB storage. If you need more storage, you can also add microSD card up to 128GBConnectivity and Dual SIM :--The Samsung Galaxy On8 supports connectivity options including 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS and NFC. Nowadays, dual SIM slots are mandatory in the mid-ranger and Galaxy On8 neatly ticks the box here. It also has VoLTE (voice-over-LTE) support for Reliance Jio.Both the SIM slots support 4G LTE and dual standby mode, which in turn allows us to take calls from second SIM even if you are on a call from first SIM. It also has USB on-the-go (OTG) support so that you can connect OTG drives easily. In addition, we also tested the call reception and was pretty satisfied with the experience we got.Performance and storage :--The Octa-Core Exynos 7580 processor clocked at 1.6GHz combined with 3GB RAM provides a butter smooth performance without any noticeable lag or hang. The Samsung Galaxy On8 is definitely fast enough for daily usage and multitasking applications. At this price range, the phone has enough power to offer sufficient performance in the everyday task.Battery :--The Samsung Galaxy On8 is powered by a 3300mAh battery without any quick charging technology. With average usage including calls, browsing Wi-Fi, video calls the smartphone is good for one full day.It also comes with Ultra power saver mode, which saves juices by applying a greyscale theme to your home screen and limiting the number of usable apps. Also, you can replace the battery very easily as it comes with the removable battery options.In our battery test the Galaxy On8 achieved a One Charge Rating of 13 hours and 44 minutes, better than the Galaxy On7 that scored a One Charge Rating of 12 hours and 42 minutes.Camera :--The Samsung Galaxy On8 comes with 13MP rear camera with f/1.9 aperture, and 5MP front camera with single LED flash on both sides.The user interface of the camera is the app is simple without any complications and similar to other Samsung smartphones.It comes with varieties of options including \u2014 mode (Auto, Pro, Panorama, Continuous shot HDR (Rich tone), Night, Beauty face, sports and sound shots), effects negative, sepia, grayscale), timer, picture size, and settings.This smartphone lets you launch the camera app by just pressing the home button twice and use the volume rockers as a camera shutter. To our surprise, the day light shots and macro shots are impressive with fine amount of details and sharpness. The 5MP front camera also proves to be good under perfect day light conditions.But when it comes to low light, the noises are almost present in all areas with loss of details. When turned on the flash under low light, the detailing of subject is decent without light over powering itConclusion :--On the whole, the Samsung Galaxy On8 is definitely an improvement over it predecessor On7 with few refinements that doesn\u2019t go above and beyond. Even though it doesn\u2019t have creative ingredients, it does fares in most of the part when it comes to the mid-range segment.The Galaxy On8 definitely benefits from the design, display, and front facing LED flash which is the most noticeable feature here. Lack of fingerprint sensor, notification LED, and other such options make us turn our head away from Galaxy On8. To sum it up, the Samsung Galaxy On8 is a pretty neat package at Rs. 15,990, until you take a look at other alternatives/rivals.Lets see its Pros & Cons,Pros :--> Good display> Front selfie flash> Dual SIM slots with 4G LTE support> Decent Battery backupCons :--> Lacks fingerprint sensor> Low loudspeaker output> No fast charging support========================================================You can buy this phone at discount from here :-- http://amzn.to/2nP1ltF========================================================Hope this review is helpful for you all,Please appreciate my review by hitting \"Helpful Vote\" button.",

            "review_text": "3. The RAM is of 3 GB which is more than enough for multitasking without any lags.4. Previous Samsung camera has never been disappointing and so as this one as well. For the primary it has a 13 megapixel sensor which takes very good quality images. It comes with an array of features like animated photo, anti-fog, continuous shot, HDR (high dynamic range), auto beauty face, panorama, sports and pro.5. Apart from the primary one the secondary camera is also very very good in low light conditions because of the larger f/1.9 focal aperture. It also has a LED flash on the front panel which can capture selfies even in absolute darkness.6. It comes with a dedicated memory card slot which can expand its memory up to 128 GB with a microSD card.7. The operating system is the latest version of Android Marshmallow and on top of that it comes with a smooth Samsung TouchWiz user interface.8. The body material is made out of metal which is very premium and also the overall thickness is of only 7.8 mm. So from the design standpoint its without a compromise.9. The 3300 mAh battery is large enough to last throughout the day even for an avid user. However gamers might need to recharge more than once during a day.10. Yes, it also supports USB OTG cable for connecting flash drives (pen drives).11. Does it supports Reliance Jio 4G? Yup, it works with Reliance Jio internet. Also it has VoLTE (voice over LTE networks).12. And the last pros is the dedicate navigational touch buttons which are placed below the screen.Reasons Not to Buy Samsung Galaxy On8 (Cons, Demerits or Negatives):1. The internal memory is of only 16 GB which is too less for a 16k priced smartphone. Moreover in actual only 10 GB out of the 16 GB is left for the user.2. Next Galaxy On8 cons or demerits is that there is no NFC (near field communication).3. Also the Gyroscope sensor is missing which is very important for playing AR (augmented reality) games like Pokemon Go and others.4. For a smartphone this expensive it should have come with a fingerprint sensor.5. There is no LED notification light as well which is a cons.6. It does not have a USB Type-C reversible connector.7. Next Samsung Galaxy On8 cons is that infrared sensor for IR blaster is also absent.8. There is no fast charging technology for the 3300 mAh battery.9. And the last Galaxy On8 cons is the absence of a display protection like Corning Gorilla Glass 3 or Asahi Dragontrail glass.My Verdict:  If you can compromise the cons then its still a great phone. But in case if you cannot compromise then go for better alternatives like Lenovo Vibe K5 Note",

Took more than a week to deliver this one and on top of that showing duplicate tracking updates just to show some activity in the back-end which seemed fake!So the initial experience is not so good!",

            "review_posted_date": "23 February 2017", 
            "review_text": "Reasons to Buy Samsung Galaxy On8 (Pros, Merit or Positives):1. The first noticeable is the display which is a full HD Super AMOLED screen for the 5.5 inches. Comparatively the Super AMOLED is far better than an IPS LCD with better viewing angles and lower power consumption.2. Next pros is the processor which is a 1.6 GHz Octa-core Exynos 7580 chipset. In fact this is the cheapest Samsung devices to come with an Octa-core CPU and its real fast. Compared to Snapdragon Exynos have less heating issues.3. The RAM is of 3 GB which is more than enough for multitasking without any lags.4. Previous Samsung camera has never been disappointing and so as this one as well. For the primary it has a 13 megapixel sensor which takes very good quality images. It comes with an array of features like animated photo, anti-fog, continuous shot, HDR (high dynamic range), auto beauty face, panorama, sports and pro.5. Apart from the primary one the secondary camera is also very very good in low light conditions because of the larger f/1.9 focal aperture. It also has a LED flash on the front panel which can capture selfies even in absolute darkness.6. It comes with a dedicated memory card slot which can expand its memory up to 128 GB with a microSD card.7. The operating system is the latest version of Android Marshmallow and on top of that it comes with a smooth Samsung TouchWiz user interface.8. The body material is made out of metal which is very premium and also the overall thickness is of only 7.8 mm. So from the design standpoint its without a compromise.9. The 3300 mAh battery is large enough to last throughout the day even for an avid user. However gamers might need to recharge more than once during a day.10. Yes, it also supports USB OTG cable for connecting flash drives (pen drives).11. Does it supports Reliance Jio 4G? Yup, it works with Reliance Jio internet. Also it has VoLTE (voice over LTE networks).12. And the last pros is the dedicate navigational touch buttons which are placed below the screen.Reasons Not to Buy Samsung Galaxy On8 (Cons, Demerits or Negatives):1. The internal memory is of only 16 GB which is too less for a 16k priced smartphone. Moreover in actual only 10 GB out of the 16 GB is left for the user.2. Next Galaxy On8 cons or demerits is that there is no NFC (near field communication).3. Also the Gyroscope sensor is missing which is very important for playing AR (augmented reality) games like Pokemon Go and others.4. For a smartphone this expensive it should have come with a fingerprint sensor.5. There is no LED notification light as well which is a cons.6. It does not have a USB Type-C reversible connector.7. Next Samsung Galaxy On8 cons is that infrared sensor for IR blaster is also absent.8. There is no fast charging technology for the 3300 mAh battery.9. And the last Galaxy On8 cons is the absence of a display protection like Corning Gorilla Glass 3 or Asahi Dragontrail glass.",
