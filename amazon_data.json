While autofocus performance is a little below average, and the limited external controls and smaller size may be a turn off for some, the D3300 excels in most areas. If you're ready to make the jump to a DSLR camera, the Nikon D3300 provides a nice starting point with a great combination of image quality, ease of use and price.PROSExcellent image quality with lots of fine detail; Very good high ISO performance; Good dynamic range; Good print quality; Deep buffers with JPEGs; 1080/60p video; Uncompressed HDMI output.CONSAF struggles in low-light; Contrast-detect AF in live view is slow; Buffer depth is shallow with RAW files; No AE bracketing; No built-in Wi-Fi.I Hope That You Find It Helpful If Yes So Please Rate It Too..",

All the items listed were inside the box. I ordered it from Cloudtail. I was able to register camera and the lens in Nikon website. Warranty card was available in the box without seller stamp. I did not verify from Nikon Service center though reg warranty.About the cam,This is my first DSLR, and i think i did the right thing choosing this 3300.Latest model, good mega pixel (24mp), Good low light performance (less noise), high dynamic range (darker and brighter in same image), great video quality, decent battery. Simply no regrets. I referred many youtube training videos and pdf about photography. I really could not stop using the cam almost every second day just to try out every technique out there, and its really fun throughout. D3300 simply shines in every department.I too checked and very confused between Canon and Nikon.I referred snapsort.com to compare and choose D3300 over 1200D, 600D, 700D. Nothing seems to come in the way of D3300 other than D5200.Between Canon and Nikon, clear difference is builtin auto focus motor in canon which makes lens price cheaper compare to 3300.If one asks me, i would say choose the brand which you would want to permanently get associated to. Cause neither way you are going to miss anything. Generally when upgrading one would stick to same brand. Nikon has everything Canon has with respect to family of lenses/cameras and vice versa. If your 1st DSLR may not be your last go for wither canon or nikon. If it is ur last, then close your eyes and go for D3300.",

            "review_text": "This item is very well packed by amazon shipping. overall item appears new and in sealed pack. But after checking in detail I found some grease /oil/ dust on Lens mirror, that also appears on viewfinder. As a newbie i didn't take any risk to clean it by myself. And this also something I was not expecting from a NEW Camera. So 4/5 star.Took some test images and videos, which came out good. After playing with for a week, here are the things would like to recommend to new buyers to considerRecommendation :18-55mm lens kit is something you need to upgrade instantly (you will notice its limitation just in a week after taking some shots). Must have 50mm prime lens and 18-104mm lens (under 20K budget).Also upgrade to 32GB Class10 SD card. For any HD /RAW files 8GB is very limited. For 8GB you can take max 260 RAW only Images or 30-40 min Video @ 1080 60FPS.Also have Nikon Remote Shutter , which you can get under 200 bucks. Not necessary to go for Branded one.Go for D5300 over D3300 Why?I found that D5300 support HDR and Timer (Time-laps settings) and it has 39 focus pt. All these 3 features really matters to explore some more creativity. Also Fold-able LCD does helps at many case, mostly When you are Recording Videos.Adobe Lightroom 5 supports Nikon DSLR tethering only upto D5XXX series. It doesn't support for D3XXX series. Which is important, because I am more into Product Photography. So Live view helps a lot to get better images, also save time for post processing work.Wifi n GPS does sounds good, but remember theses two are also power hungry. But it also give you some additional feature to control with your Smartphone. If you are a traveler-blogger, Wifi-GPS can give you good experience.So spending on a D5300 body only with 15000 bucks can give you more reliable DSLR camera, that you can use for 2-3 years. I am going to upgrade to D5300 or D5500 in next 2-3 months, So I could have easily save 30 grand , if some mention theses things earlier.-Chinmay",

The sensor is the same, the mega pixel count is the same. Heck D3300 doesn't even have a light filter making each pixel square accept more light. This is advanced DSLR category!I got it at a fantastic price on Amazon. Opted for next day delivery. No probs at all.Went to a 40 day trip to Canada, captured more than 7000 pictures. The images are crisp, color tones perfect, out of the box 'Auto Mode' captures pretty decent (at times even better than manual!) images. Low light performance is also acceptable. Though one needs a bit more practice at low shttee speeds and without a tripod. If you plan to explore night life with this serious camera, you'd definately need a tripod. Otherwise no complains at all. Already feel like I have got my investment's return!I also captured tons of Full HD videos. God the only thing I missed is the image stabilization coz on a 42\" 3D tv the lack of motion soothing is heavily missed. Yet when you know what you're doing, D3300 takes mind boggling videos!The lens along with the kit is the ED VR 18-55 mm Nikkor lens. It does the job perfectly for your day to day photography. But I am just so sure looking at the specs that the D3300 has tons more to offer so planing to by a Prime lens and also a zoom/macro lens in the near future.The party has only just started!",
