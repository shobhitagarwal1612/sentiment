            "review_text": "First of all good service from Amazon.in, timely delivery before the expected date. Coming to the product, this is my first DSLR and I have researched online for at least 3 months before getting into a conclusion. It is by far the best among the beginners level DSLR in the 25-45k range. Got confused whether to buy\u00a0Nikon D3300\u00a0or\u00a0Nikon D5200\u00a0but chose this one due to better ISO and faster processor and newer version. I am using this camera since almost 2 months now and after using this I am shocked how can a beginners DSLR give performance like this.Before heading into the review, I would like to mention the contents of the box.\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bfIN THE BOX:\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf Nikon D3300 Body, with body cap.\u29bf Nikkor AF-S 18-55 mm f/3.5-5.6 VR II Kit Lens.\u29bf EN-EL14a Li-ion Battery, with a terminal cover.\u29bf MH-24 Battery Charger.\u29bf UC-E17 Data Transfer USB Cable.\u29bf EG-CP14 AV cable.\u29bf Nikon Strap.\u29bf View NX2 CD-ROM.\u29bf User Manual.\u29bf Warranty Card x 2  1. Two years Warranty Card with the serial Number of the Camera  2. One year International Warranty Card with the serial number of the lens  [Note: Though the two warranty cards comes with either one of the serial numbers, that does not mean it is only applicable to the lens or  camera only, both the warranty cards are applicable to both camera body and lens. Another thing the other accessories are not covered  under any warranty]\u29bf 8 GB SD Card (Taped outside the box)\u29bf Nikon DSLR Camera Bag\u29bf Two Nikon School CDs and one invitation. (Received it as a offer, may not be applicable in your case)[Note the camera does not come with an Accessory Hot-Shoe Cover, unlike other models, so you have to buy it separately, if you need to protect your hot-shoe, it costs around 35 INR in normal camera shop.]\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714PROS:\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714 The Sensor: Well o well, the 24 MP sensor that you get in this camera is the same one as that of the\u00a0Nikon D7100\u00a0and\u00a0Nikon D5300\u00a0which speaks much of the picture quality you are going to get with this camera. The sensor has a total pixel density of 24.78 pixels, which result in images having much details, while sacrificing the low light performance a bit.\u2714 The camera comes with a faster and more improved processor, the Expeed 4 Processing Engine which lets the camera to process images and especially videos faster than the older models. This is the main reason why the camera's got faster frame rates than the predecessors.\u2714 The camera does not come with OLPF(Optical Low Pass Filter) which results in significantly sharper images. Nikon is doing a new upgrade in their cameras nowadays i.e, they are removing the Low Pass Filter, so as a result, the camera can now capture both types of light i.e, with shorter wavelength and longer wavelength which ultimately makes the images much more sharper.\u2714 The camera has a 11 point focus system, which is awesome for a camera at this price tag. You get a single cross type focus point in the middle and other 10 normal focus points surrounding the frame. This 11 focus points can do a fast auto focus while paired up with a good lens and it also has 3D tracking functionality. This 11 points are also very helpful and fast responsive during manual focusing.\u2714 The ISO performance is very good for a beginner's DSLR at 12800 and a boost ISO of 25600. More importantly this camera has low noise at 1385 ISO which is awesome. But try to avoid ISO more than 3200 until it is a pitch black scene, because that would produce much noise in the images.\u2714 The battery backup is also great, 700 shots is very much unexpected from a camera of this configuration but Nikon seems to have got it right. The EN-EL14a battery is an upgraded version of the EN-EL14 battery which used to come with the\u00a0Nikon D3200\u00a0and it has increased mAh and efficient power handling.\u2714 The kit lens is very good and it has a much faster auto-focus than the predecessor and is also much compact and lighter. Most importantly the lens comes with VR II motor, which is very useful for a beginner having problems to hold the camera still at earlier stages of photography. It keeps that 52 mm filter thread so no worries for ones who have 52 mm filter from your old lenses, you can use them on this.\u2714 1080p 60fps, now this is a big deal, even some of the advanced DSLRs can't go that far but this does. Very helpful if you need to shoot action. I have been shooting fast action videos with lag free performance at 1080p 60 fps, thanks to the faster new Expeed 4 processor, which has a super fast processing speed.\u2714 You get 5fps 24.0MP RAW files which is awesome but you need a good and faster card for that the offered card can't keep up with that speed. Well a good recommendation and in fact the best card will be\u00a0SanDisk Extreme Pro, it offers fantastic write speed of 72.8mbps for this camera and the buffer never clicks in if you shoot at burst mode using this card, just you have to keep in mind that the shutter needs to be pressed after every 100 shots to continue burst shooting.\u2714 The camera has a good colour depth of 24.3 bits which produces vivid colours on the images and you can see the effect of those 24.3 bits during post processing.\u2714 The camera comes with a 3 inch 921k dots LCD display, which may not be the best monitor in the world, but certainly it is bright enough and produces vivid colours close to real world view.\u2714 Easy Panaroma mode -  Now it is like a bonus though you hardly need it, but handy at times. Remember you are capturing a panaroma from a DSLR so the picture would be much much better than what you may take with phones.\u2714 Very compact camera. It does not seem like a DSLR if you hold it in your palm, it is so compact and light. The camera only weighs about 450 g (without the battery), which is super light when you are talking about a DSLR of this performance.\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718CONS:\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718 The ISO can be used at one full stop, so you can't get the 1/3rd or 1/2nd stop ISO at manual mode, but you get that in auto mode, that is may be something Nikon has not made due to simplicity for beginners, but that is not so great a deal due to good ISO performance of this camera.\u2718 The camera can shoot only 12 bit RAW files, unlike 14 bits in the Nikon D5xxx series, which although produces great image quality, but that extra elegance goes somewhere missing. Though you can hardly notice that until you shoot it at 14 bits RAW and compare the two.\u2718 No articulating screen, this is something that would have been better to have for shooting at tricky situations, but that also would have raised the price. But personally I did not give that much priority. Also in professional DSLRs you hardly get that articulating screen.That said the cons are not that big deal considering the price of this camera and that it is build focusing mostly for the beginners.\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8VERDICT:\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8Overall a wonderful camera to be owned. The camera bag offered is also fair enough. Many of us think that camera does the job, if we have good camera we can get good images but that is not the thing, a photographer makes the photograph unique not the camera. Yes, there are some limitations but still that is not that important for good shots. This camera just has more features compared to counterparts from Canon or Sony, or any other company at the same price point but that is not a great deal for photography, this is just a bit advanced. Well I have attached some shots taken with the camera and the camera itself. Thank you for reading this much. I will update the review after more usage in depth. Please hit Yes if you found my review helpful, if not then you can comment on the review with your issue and I will definitely help you. Happy Shopping!!!",

            "review_posted_date": "19 September 2016", 
            "review_text": "Nikon has released a new kit lens in 2016 that is compatible with D3300. There are various kit lenses before it. This is what you need to understand :AF- S 18-55mm VR - oldestAF- S 18-55mm VR II - oldAF- P 18-55mm VR- latestThe \"P\" stands for a stepping motor, a newer technology which makes the lens significantly quieter (almost silent) and slightly faster. The new lens has also slightly better performance at wide open settings. And it has VR- Vibration Reduction for image stabilization. You can read the Ken Rockwell review of this lens.I've seen many people being angry at the seller for sending them the AF-P VR lens which is the latest, complaining that they did not get the VR II lens. You should be actually thanking them for sending you the latest lens and not the old one.The new Kit lens requires a firmware update for Nikon D3300( V1.01). But the orders placed now and afterwards will receive cameras with the latest firmware inbuilt.About the camera, you know its the best. Splendid image quality equivalent to higher end Nikon DX cameras. So even if you buy the D7200, there wouldn't be a big difference in image quality. The controls n features change.Reasons why you might want to consider Canon 1200D(1300D has no worthy improvement) :1) You want DSLR quality photos. Nikon just does it better. But Canon's still a DSLR with a big sensor. Great photos there too.2) If you don't shoot RAW or if you don't post process your photos, get the Canon. (This is where Nikon's sensor really shines, at getting the fine details back)3) You will get the 2 lens option with Canon under 23K (on good seasons) and that second lens is a  55-250mm IS II. A very good telephoto lens. So if you're not going to buy another lens at all, Canon has a better deal.4) Canon lenses are usually cheaper. Like the 50mm f1.8 portrait lens. Nikon cost 10,000 INR while Canon's variant is around or below 8000 INR.5)Canon has a very cheap wide lens, the 10-18mm. Nikon doesn't !Canon Cons :1) No amazing sensor. Canon's sensor is smaller in size too. Hence less efficient. But still capable of DSLR quality images. Nikon takes better shots under low light.2) Not for video lovers. No mic jack on Canon. Does not do 60fps which is required for slow mo. Nikon has a mic jack for clear external audio and it does 60fps too.3) Nikon is smaller and lighter.4) Battery. Nikon has double the battery capability compared to Canon.Both have no touch screen nor a screen that tilts. The Kit lens that comes with Nikon is significantly better than Canon's. So it takes great pictures. Sample shots can be seen at Pixelpeeper or Flickr.And yes, the kits lens can blur the background at 55mm f5.6.Lenses to buy afterwards, if you're serious about photography :1) Nikon AF P 70-300 VR. Stabilized lens for 14-15k is a great deal. Autofocus is really fast but the aperture at 300mm is 6.3. So it would struggle a bit under low light situations. A major wildlife photographer needs something like the Tamron 150-600mm lens.2) Nikon 35mm f1.8G. An all around amazing lens. This lens makes you a better photographer. Fixed prime, meaning no zoom. But unmatched image quality at this price. Great for indoor shots too.3) A wide angle lens. Expensive Tokina 11-16mm.4) If portraits are a big deal to you, only then go for the 50mm f1.8 G.Overall an amazing camera. You cannot go wrong with this one. Just make sure you really need a DSLR and its features. If you're someone who needs better images than smartphones with a good flash, better portability and going to shoot in Auto Mode anyway, you're looking for a point and shoot camera and the new ones takes great pictures under good light.",

            "review_text": "I always had questions in my mind why i need a DSLR? i already have phone and a high megapixel digital camera.But the deal amazon was providing for this product was great, so i did some research and decided to buy this product.To begin with delivery package was very good it had everything to protect my device during logistics.Everything was as described in description of this product.When i initially held the device in my hand i was overwhelmed by number of buttons, for initial few hours i was using auto mode and results were not upto the expectations. but when i view the Tutorial session(of 80 mins) which was provided with package, it was only then i was able to understand the feature of each button and technicality of product. overall it is very easy to learn about utilizing the DSLR to its full capacity.So if you have hands on experience with DSLR then you will love this (at this price), if you are a newbie even then you will love this (although it has 90 mins of learning curve).Deducting 1 start as it did not have a HDR feature inbuilt, as it is manufactured in 2014 so it was expected out of it. apart from that it has everything to offer what you expect from a DSLR.It is worth every penny you invested to keep your memories alive forever. :)",

            "review_posted_date": "7 November 2014", 
            "review_text": "General Observations about Amazon, packaging & warrantyProduct ordered on 15th Oct --- Delivered on 29th Oct....!!!Packaging was very good.No dealer stamp on warranty and Bill doesnt contain product number which may be a problem for warranty, have to clarify with amazon regarding this, Before purchase i asked them about warranty and they have assured if u buy from Amazon fulfilled supplier amazon will give warranty even if nikon does not gives thats when i decided to buy online since it was 6k cheaper than authorized dealers which will save u money to buy an extra lens!!!Now about the Nikon masterpiece D3300Before buying any expensive product online it is mandatory for us all to do a research about the competetion and available products within our budget. Please compare the available products in ur price range only like u can not compare D3300 with a DSLR costing 55K...It will come down to Canon 1200D with zoom lens kit, D3200, D5200 and Canon 600D.All between 26-32k range. Nikon D3100 & Canon 1100D etc are old models and are still cheaper so i didnt considered them.Being a first DSLR hands down almost 99% of google recommemds D3300. I went to Nikon and Canon dealers and checked all models in this budget. heres why i went for D3300 & the after experience :1) It offers u latest processor and sensor with VR-II kit lens.2) The Battery Life is Best in its class with remarkable nos ahead from the competetion and i felt the same after using it.3) Its really very handy and small compared to D5200, only thing 5200 has a tilt screen but i felt it will not make that much difference, for fitting a tilt screen the size of the camera becomes large. I read a lot since my final two models were 5200 and 3300 and felt that the latest processor and better battery life and a diff of 6k for D3300 will be good for my requirements. Since nowhere u can find exceptional difference between image quality of the two cameras. HDR u will hardly require and tilt screen for me was not a priority.4) The image quality is superb. it has a child mode which is very useful when u dont have time for manual settings. Auto mode produces fine images when u dont have time for settings.5) Comes with 8GB card which will be sufficient for few months till u conquer all skills of photography.6) Bag is ok but not very stylish. Can accomodate an extra lens easily.7) Camera is very very fast, first time users will fall in love with the speed of the camera absolutely no lags anywhere.8) Photograps in low light and indoor pics at evening or night time are also very impressive. Flash does an excellent job.9) Colour reproduction is superb, if u click vegetables and look on HDTV they look way better than they look in real life :)...10) I was not used to click pics through view finder so i thought live view is a very useful feature for a DSLR but in real life u will  hardly use live view once u get ur hands on unless a position where u cant put ur head below the cam, even with specks it is  very easy to shoot using view finder .11) LCD screen is very good. With high resolution screen u can judge the quality of image immediatly after clicking which is difficult if  the LCD resolution is low.12) Nikon website is very informative and helps a lot u can register for nikon school and refer tutorials.13) Canon 1200D with Kit lens & zoom lens is a very tough competetion since Nikon D3300 with similar zoom lens is 10K more but  after a lot of reading from websites and reviews u will find that for image quality nikon is a clear winner at entry level DSLR by a  far margin. Kit lens will fulfil most of ur photography requirements initially, wait till u discover urself what lens u really require  before going on to purchase the combo pack with zoom lens.  Hence i decided to buy D3300 and leave the zoom lens in to be bought further category.14) It takes a little time for autofocus at night in very low light but it is ok otherwise autofocus in all other conditions is excellent.  captures fast moving objects in the frame perfectly.15) Manual supplied in the box is useful, and should be read first if u r using a DSLR for the first time.16) It has a wifi feature which may b useful for clicking pics using ur smart phone but requires u to purchase a dongle.It feels excellent to click from this cam because of its fine ergonomics, small size and light weight. its a worth investment. Its a long road in learning and mastering the techniques in photography, with nikon u will enjoy learing it coz when u do it right it delivers excellent results.... just remember a quote which i like very much :\"\"\" Buying a Nikon doesnt makes u a photographer... it only makes u the owner of the Nikon Camera...\"\"\"So keep learning....",

I would suggest for the person who's buying it, that the kit lens is really good. You would definitely want to buy a 35mm f/1.8 lens(Since its a DX camera its better to go for 35 instead of 50mm) for the Bokeh effect to take great images of objects up close or portraits because the kit lens is not really great at producing bokeh because of the aperture limitations. Bokeh is the effect which makes the background appear blurred out. As an Indian, and if you're someone who's bought an entry level DSLR like this one, definitely go for the other lens for the portraits it will make a huge difference in the photographs you'll take.What the kit lens will do for you, however, is take great images. Honestly 18-55 is rock solid stuff. This lens is really really good and its a steal if you go for the kit lens+body.The video quality is through the roof. For the price I've paid I'm really really satisfied with my camera.Good luck shooting!PS: I'm tagging some photos that I personally took in the last 2 days after I received this camera. These are all in JPEG format.This is the absolute best camera in this price range. Don't think twice about this, just go for it. :)",

I would have rated it a 5 on 5 except for some issues-1) when i had ordered the camera it was listed at 28400 or thereabouts. I got the product for 28990. since I have been waiting quite sometime, and the price currently is this, i had no choice but to buy.This means the price you see on ordering may not remain the same as the price you get in delivery which is rather strange.2) the kit clearly says 8 gb card included. the box and all were completely sealed ( i checked them myself) but the memory card is just not there.any help will be sincerely appreciated.for the camera 5/5 (i could give a 6/5 :P)the best camera you could buy for the money. definitely better than the d5200. apart from the extra 1 point dynamic range, it is the same thing as far as sensor and all go. plus you get all the advanced features of the d5200 the most time saving one being the automatic distortion control. just download the latest firmware and it will take in any lens you could possibly put on it.advise is add a uvc filter and invest in a lens hood.the automatic hdr on 5200 is crap. if you really are into HDR photography you will have to take multiple shots and merge them on your computer to get proper effects.same goes for landscape (which the d3300 has and d5200 does not).plus the 3300 takes 700 plus hots compared to the 5200 which takes 500 odd shots (and yes i have used both).if you cant afford a leica, or if you are cagey about buying the fuji x, this is the smallest, lightest camera with no oplf filter (sharper images) that you can buy India for under 30000 for street photography. Pair it up with a 35mm 1.8 nikon for more light control. 5fps shooting is more than enough unless you are doing very serious sports photography.",

            "review_text": "It\u2019s odd to think how quickly camera technology can pass from the realm of the pro to the amateur, from cutting-edge to pass\u00e9. Once upon a time we were all astounded by the 24.5MP resolution of the Nikon D3X, a camera designed for professional photographers who were willing to spend \u00a34200 on their gear. Four years later and some people might reasonably be disappointed that the entry-level \u00a3500 Nikon D3300 'only' carries the same 24.2MP resolution as its direct predecessor the D3200. How things change.Despite the identical resolutions of the Nikon D3300 and D3200, there is one very important difference that impacts image quality. For the D3300, Nikon has removed the optical anti-aliasing filter. This is a filter installed in digital cameras to reduce occurrences of optical aberrations such as moir\u00e9 patterning \u2013 unwanted artifacts appearing on images that feature repetitive detail patterns. While anti-aliasing filters reduce this effect, the cost is a loss in sharpness. Recently it has become a trendy move for camera manufacturers to remove the filters entirely in favour of optimal sharpness, relying on big megapixel counts to cope with any moir\u00e9-causing patterns.The effect for a camera like the D3300 is that its high-resolution sensor is now able to capture every possible detail, putting it in the same league with more advanced (and more expensive) cameras. And with that, things get more interesting.NIKON D3300 VS D3200: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?The resolution may be the same as the D3200, but the D3300 has plenty of other improvements under the bonnet. Chief among these is the new Expeed 4 image-processing engine. Nikon\u2019s fastest processor yet, it improves the D3300\u2019s ISO sensitivity to an impressive maximum of 25,600 and its shooting rate to 5fps \u2013 not top of the league but very impressive for an entry-level camera. There are also a few new automatic flash modes, including an option for fill flash.It\u2019s worth noting that there is plenty that remains the same from the previous model in the series. You\u2019ve got an 11-point AF system, a 3-inch 921k-dot rear screen and a 420 pixel RGB sensor metering system, all things that D3200 users will find thoroughly familiar. The D3300 shoots images in JPEG and 12-bit Raw formats, and is capable of saving them to SD, SDHC or SDXC memory cards.The D3300 also carries one big absence over from its predecessor: built-in Wi-Fi. While Nikon (finally) introduced built-in wi-fi with the D5300, the technology did not carry over to the D3300, which still relies on the separately available WU-1a adapter. It\u2019s not a huge annoyance, just be aware that you\u2019ll have to shell out an extra \u00a340 or so if you want to use Wi-Fi on your D3300.Elsewhere there are a number of other optional extras on the D3300. You can attach the Nikon GP-1 module to a socket on the side of the camera in order to geotag images. There are also a number of additional shooting modes: a Rangefinder Mode (finding which requires a little digging into the menus); Mirror Lock-Up, though only for sensor cleaning, not for shooting; Easy Panorama, which automatically stitches several images together; and Effects Mode, with visual filters such as high-key and Selective Colour.To pair with the D3300, Nikon unveiled a new retractable kit lens, the F-S DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II lens, an impressively sharp number with a minimum focus distance of 25cm (when manually focusing; 28cm with AF). As the camera lacks a built-in AF motor it requires AF-S lenses in order to be able to autofocus.",

            "review_text": "First of all good service from Amazon.in, timely delivery before the expected date. Coming to the product, this is my first DSLR and I have researched online for at least 3 months before getting into a conclusion. It is by far the best among the beginners level DSLR in the 25-45k range. Got confused whether to buy\u00a0Nikon D3300\u00a0or\u00a0Nikon D5200\u00a0but chose this one due to better ISO and faster processor and newer version. I am using this camera since almost 2 months now and after using this I am shocked how can a beginners DSLR give performance like this.Before heading into the review, I would like to mention the contents of the box.\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bfIN THE BOX:\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf Nikon D3300 Body, with body cap.\u29bf Nikkor AF-S 18-55 mm f/3.5-5.6 VR II Kit Lens.\u29bf EN-EL14a Li-ion Battery, with a terminal cover.\u29bf MH-24 Battery Charger.\u29bf UC-E17 Data Transfer USB Cable.\u29bf EG-CP14 AV cable.\u29bf Nikon Strap.\u29bf View NX2 CD-ROM.\u29bf User Manual.\u29bf Warranty Card x 2  1. Two years Warranty Card with the serial Number of the Camera  2. One year International Warranty Card with the serial number of the lens  [Note: Though the two warranty cards comes with either one of the serial numbers, that does not mean it is only applicable to the lens or  camera only, both the warranty cards are applicable to both camera body and lens. Another thing the other accessories are not covered  under any warranty]\u29bf 8 GB SD Card (Taped outside the box)\u29bf Nikon DSLR Camera Bag\u29bf Two Nikon School CDs and one invitation. (Received it as a offer, may not be applicable in your case)[Note the camera does not come with an Accessory Hot-Shoe Cover, unlike other models, so you have to buy it separately, if you need to protect your hot-shoe, it costs around 35 INR in normal camera shop.]\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714PROS:\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714 The Sensor: Well o well, the 24 MP sensor that you get in this camera is the same one as that of the\u00a0Nikon D7100\u00a0and\u00a0Nikon D5300\u00a0which speaks much of the picture quality you are going to get with this camera. The sensor has a total pixel density of 24.78 pixels, which result in images having much details, while sacrificing the low light performance a bit.\u2714 The camera comes with a faster and more improved processor, the Expeed 4 Processing Engine which lets the camera to process images and especially videos faster than the older models. This is the main reason why the camera's got faster frame rates than the predecessors.\u2714 The camera does not come with OLPF(Optical Low Pass Filter) which results in significantly sharper images. Nikon is doing a new upgrade in their cameras nowadays i.e, they are removing the Low Pass Filter, so as a result, the camera can now capture both types of light i.e, with shorter wavelength and longer wavelength which ultimately makes the images much more sharper.\u2714 The camera has a 11 point focus system, which is awesome for a camera at this price tag. You get a single cross type focus point in the middle and other 10 normal focus points surrounding the frame. This 11 focus points can do a fast auto focus while paired up with a good lens and it also has 3D tracking functionality. This 11 points are also very helpful and fast responsive during manual focusing.\u2714 The ISO performance is very good for a beginner's DSLR at 12800 and a boost ISO of 25600. More importantly this camera has low noise at 1385 ISO which is awesome. But try to avoid ISO more than 3200 until it is a pitch black scene, because that would produce much noise in the images.\u2714 The battery backup is also great, 700 shots is very much unexpected from a camera of this configuration but Nikon seems to have got it right. The EN-EL14a battery is an upgraded version of the EN-EL14 battery which used to come with the\u00a0Nikon D3200\u00a0and it has increased mAh and efficient power handling.\u2714 The kit lens is very good and it has a much faster auto-focus than the predecessor and is also much compact and lighter. Most importantly the lens comes with VR II motor, which is very useful for a beginner having problems to hold the camera still at earlier stages of photography. It keeps that 52 mm filter thread so no worries for ones who have 52 mm filter from your old lenses, you can use them on this.\u2714 1080p 60fps, now this is a big deal, even some of the advanced DSLRs can't go that far but this does. Very helpful if you need to shoot action. I have been shooting fast action videos with lag free performance at 1080p 60 fps, thanks to the faster new Expeed 4 processor, which has a super fast processing speed.\u2714 You get 5fps 24.0MP RAW files which is awesome but you need a good and faster card for that the offered card can't keep up with that speed. Well a good recommendation and in fact the best card will be\u00a0SanDisk Extreme Pro, it offers fantastic write speed of 72.8mbps for this camera and the buffer never clicks in if you shoot at burst mode using this card, just you have to keep in mind that the shutter needs to be pressed after every 100 shots to continue burst shooting.\u2714 The camera has a good colour depth of 24.3 bits which produces vivid colours on the images and you can see the effect of those 24.3 bits during post processing.\u2714 The camera comes with a 3 inch 921k dots LCD display, which may not be the best monitor in the world, but certainly it is bright enough and produces vivid colours close to real world view.\u2714 Easy Panaroma mode -  Now it is like a bonus though you hardly need it, but handy at times. Remember you are capturing a panaroma from a DSLR so the picture would be much much better than what you may take with phones.\u2714 Very compact camera. It does not seem like a DSLR if you hold it in your palm, it is so compact and light. The camera only weighs about 450 g (without the battery), which is super light when you are talking about a DSLR of this performance.\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718CONS:\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718 The ISO can be used at one full stop, so you can't get the 1/3rd or 1/2nd stop ISO at manual mode, but you get that in auto mode, that is may be something Nikon has not made due to simplicity for beginners, but that is not so great a deal due to good ISO performance of this camera.\u2718 The camera can shoot only 12 bit RAW files, unlike 14 bits in the Nikon D5xxx series, which although produces great image quality, but that extra elegance goes somewhere missing. Though you can hardly notice that until you shoot it at 14 bits RAW and compare the two.\u2718 No articulating screen, this is something that would have been better to have for shooting at tricky situations, but that also would have raised the price. But personally I did not give that much priority. Also in professional DSLRs you hardly get that articulating screen.That said the cons are not that big deal considering the price of this camera and that it is build focusing mostly for the beginners.\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8VERDICT:\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8Overall a wonderful camera to be owned. The camera bag offered is also fair enough. Many of us think that camera does the job, if we have good camera we can get good images but that is not the thing, a photographer makes the photograph unique not the camera. Yes, there are some limitations but still that is not that important for good shots. This camera just has more features compared to counterparts from Canon or Sony, or any other company at the same price point but that is not a great deal for photography, this is just a bit advanced. Well I have attached some shots taken with the camera and the camera itself. Thank you for reading this much. I will update the review after more usage in depth. Please hit Yes if you found my review helpful, if not then you can comment on the review with your issue and I will definitely help you. Happy Shopping!!!",

            "review_posted_date": "19 September 2016", 
            "review_text": "Nikon has released a new kit lens in 2016 that is compatible with D3300. There are various kit lenses before it. This is what you need to understand :AF- S 18-55mm VR - oldestAF- S 18-55mm VR II - oldAF- P 18-55mm VR- latestThe \"P\" stands for a stepping motor, a newer technology which makes the lens significantly quieter (almost silent) and slightly faster. The new lens has also slightly better performance at wide open settings. And it has VR- Vibration Reduction for image stabilization. You can read the Ken Rockwell review of this lens.I've seen many people being angry at the seller for sending them the AF-P VR lens which is the latest, complaining that they did not get the VR II lens. You should be actually thanking them for sending you the latest lens and not the old one.The new Kit lens requires a firmware update for Nikon D3300( V1.01). But the orders placed now and afterwards will receive cameras with the latest firmware inbuilt.About the camera, you know its the best. Splendid image quality equivalent to higher end Nikon DX cameras. So even if you buy the D7200, there wouldn't be a big difference in image quality. The controls n features change.Reasons why you might want to consider Canon 1200D(1300D has no worthy improvement) :1) You want DSLR quality photos. Nikon just does it better. But Canon's still a DSLR with a big sensor. Great photos there too.2) If you don't shoot RAW or if you don't post process your photos, get the Canon. (This is where Nikon's sensor really shines, at getting the fine details back)3) You will get the 2 lens option with Canon under 23K (on good seasons) and that second lens is a  55-250mm IS II. A very good telephoto lens. So if you're not going to buy another lens at all, Canon has a better deal.4) Canon lenses are usually cheaper. Like the 50mm f1.8 portrait lens. Nikon cost 10,000 INR while Canon's variant is around or below 8000 INR.5)Canon has a very cheap wide lens, the 10-18mm. Nikon doesn't !Canon Cons :1) No amazing sensor. Canon's sensor is smaller in size too. Hence less efficient. But still capable of DSLR quality images. Nikon takes better shots under low light.2) Not for video lovers. No mic jack on Canon. Does not do 60fps which is required for slow mo. Nikon has a mic jack for clear external audio and it does 60fps too.3) Nikon is smaller and lighter.4) Battery. Nikon has double the battery capability compared to Canon.Both have no touch screen nor a screen that tilts. The Kit lens that comes with Nikon is significantly better than Canon's. So it takes great pictures. Sample shots can be seen at Pixelpeeper or Flickr.And yes, the kits lens can blur the background at 55mm f5.6.Lenses to buy afterwards, if you're serious about photography :1) Nikon AF P 70-300 VR. Stabilized lens for 14-15k is a great deal. Autofocus is really fast but the aperture at 300mm is 6.3. So it would struggle a bit under low light situations. A major wildlife photographer needs something like the Tamron 150-600mm lens.2) Nikon 35mm f1.8G. An all around amazing lens. This lens makes you a better photographer. Fixed prime, meaning no zoom. But unmatched image quality at this price. Great for indoor shots too.3) A wide angle lens. Expensive Tokina 11-16mm.4) If portraits are a big deal to you, only then go for the 50mm f1.8 G.Overall an amazing camera. You cannot go wrong with this one. Just make sure you really need a DSLR and its features. If you're someone who needs better images than smartphones with a good flash, better portability and going to shoot in Auto Mode anyway, you're looking for a point and shoot camera and the new ones takes great pictures under good light.",

The sensor is the same, the mega pixel count is the same. Heck D3300 doesn't even have a light filter making each pixel square accept more light. This is advanced DSLR category!I got it at a fantastic price on Amazon. Opted for next day delivery. No probs at all.Went to a 40 day trip to Canada, captured more than 7000 pictures. The images are crisp, color tones perfect, out of the box 'Auto Mode' captures pretty decent (at times even better than manual!) images. Low light performance is also acceptable. Though one needs a bit more practice at low shttee speeds and without a tripod. If you plan to explore night life with this serious camera, you'd definately need a tripod. Otherwise no complains at all. Already feel like I have got my investment's return!I also captured tons of Full HD videos. God the only thing I missed is the image stabilization coz on a 42\" 3D tv the lack of motion soothing is heavily missed. Yet when you know what you're doing, D3300 takes mind boggling videos!The lens along with the kit is the ED VR 18-55 mm Nikkor lens. It does the job perfectly for your day to day photography. But I am just so sure looking at the specs that the D3300 has tons more to offer so planing to by a Prime lens and also a zoom/macro lens in the near future.The party has only just started!",

The manual mode can be stressful at first but once you understand how each aspect affects a picture in the environment it is in fact a pleasure to play with and get that perfect image.The controls are easy to use and a little practice will help you get the hang of it since its not overly complicated.overall its a small and neat camera that fits snugly in your hands, and a great camera waiting to see what you can make of all it has to offer.",

            "review_text": "There is no doubt that D3300 is a good entry level DSLR as of now. I chose it after extensive homework on the internet as well as physically checking out several alternatives in camera stores. For less than the price I paid for the Nikon D3300 with 18-55 lens, I could have got a Canon 1200D with 18-55 + 55-200 lens. But I still chose the costlier Nikon because : (a) better reviews, (b) more compact with retractable kit lens, (c) more megapixels, (d) better low-light performance (higher ISO), (e) more battery life, and (f) better video mode.The camera I bought from Amazon.in was supplied by M/s DN Digitals, Pune. I received the item promptly as promised. But I found a mistake in the Invoice received along with the item -- the \"Serial No.\" mentioned in the Invoice neither matched the sl. no. of the camera body nor that of the kit lens. I immediately took up the matter with Amazon and they promised to send me a corrected Invoice which they haven't done so far.I have already sent two reminders to Amazon during the last 5 weeks. Every time they promptly reply saying they are sending the corrected Invoice but nothing happens thereafter.Those who travel abroad know that when one returns to India, Customs people often check the items one is carrying. If I'm carrying an item I took with me from India, I should be able to prove that I bought it in India and not abroad. For this purpose, I always carry the Invoice. But if the serial no. of the item in the Invoice is not matching the actual sl. no., Customs people may not accept that the item was bought in India. I have been repeatedly explaining this problem to Amazon.in but so far they have done nothing.",

            "review_text": "General Observations about Amazon, packaging & warrantyProduct ordered on 15th Oct --- Delivered on 29th Oct....!!!Packaging was very good.No dealer stamp on warranty and Bill doesnt contain product number which may be a problem for warranty, have to clarify with amazon regarding this, Before purchase i asked them about warranty and they have assured if u buy from Amazon fulfilled supplier amazon will give warranty even if nikon does not gives thats when i decided to buy online since it was 6k cheaper than authorized dealers which will save u money to buy an extra lens!!!Now about the Nikon masterpiece D3300Before buying any expensive product online it is mandatory for us all to do a research about the competetion and available products within our budget. Please compare the available products in ur price range only like u can not compare D3300 with a DSLR costing 55K...It will come down to Canon 1200D with zoom lens kit, D3200, D5200 and Canon 600D.All between 26-32k range. Nikon D3100 & Canon 1100D etc are old models and are still cheaper so i didnt considered them.Being a first DSLR hands down almost 99% of google recommemds D3300. I went to Nikon and Canon dealers and checked all models in this budget. heres why i went for D3300 & the after experience :1) It offers u latest processor and sensor with VR-II kit lens.2) The Battery Life is Best in its class with remarkable nos ahead from the competetion and i felt the same after using it.3) Its really very handy and small compared to D5200, only thing 5200 has a tilt screen but i felt it will not make that much difference, for fitting a tilt screen the size of the camera becomes large. I read a lot since my final two models were 5200 and 3300 and felt that the latest processor and better battery life and a diff of 6k for D3300 will be good for my requirements. Since nowhere u can find exceptional difference between image quality of the two cameras. HDR u will hardly require and tilt screen for me was not a priority.4) The image quality is superb. it has a child mode which is very useful when u dont have time for manual settings. Auto mode produces fine images when u dont have time for settings.5) Comes with 8GB card which will be sufficient for few months till u conquer all skills of photography.6) Bag is ok but not very stylish. Can accomodate an extra lens easily.7) Camera is very very fast, first time users will fall in love with the speed of the camera absolutely no lags anywhere.8) Photograps in low light and indoor pics at evening or night time are also very impressive. Flash does an excellent job.9) Colour reproduction is superb, if u click vegetables and look on HDTV they look way better than they look in real life :)...10) I was not used to click pics through view finder so i thought live view is a very useful feature for a DSLR but in real life u will  hardly use live view once u get ur hands on unless a position where u cant put ur head below the cam, even with specks it is  very easy to shoot using view finder .11) LCD screen is very good. With high resolution screen u can judge the quality of image immediatly after clicking which is difficult if  the LCD resolution is low.12) Nikon website is very informative and helps a lot u can register for nikon school and refer tutorials.13) Canon 1200D with Kit lens & zoom lens is a very tough competetion since Nikon D3300 with similar zoom lens is 10K more but  after a lot of reading from websites and reviews u will find that for image quality nikon is a clear winner at entry level DSLR by a  far margin. Kit lens will fulfil most of ur photography requirements initially, wait till u discover urself what lens u really require  before going on to purchase the combo pack with zoom lens.  Hence i decided to buy D3300 and leave the zoom lens in to be bought further category.14) It takes a little time for autofocus at night in very low light but it is ok otherwise autofocus in all other conditions is excellent.  captures fast moving objects in the frame perfectly.15) Manual supplied in the box is useful, and should be read first if u r using a DSLR for the first time.16) It has a wifi feature which may b useful for clicking pics using ur smart phone but requires u to purchase a dongle.It feels excellent to click from this cam because of its fine ergonomics, small size and light weight. its a worth investment. Its a long road in learning and mastering the techniques in photography, with nikon u will enjoy learing it coz when u do it right it delivers excellent results.... just remember a quote which i like very much :\"\"\" Buying a Nikon doesnt makes u a photographer... it only makes u the owner of the Nikon Camera...\"\"\"So keep learning....",

Other options considered were Canon EOS 1200 and Nikon D 5200.It has all the features you would need, 16 focal points are enough, don't need too many, LCD does not tilt but I am fine with that, how much do you need it? It has no wifi or GPS but no big deal again. It has lots of functions and gives you a versatile SLR for a reasonable price. The basic kit lens came at a bargain price. You can add a lens or two as you start using the camera. I added 1.8 mm nikon prime lens to begin with for low light performance. If you want a lens for wildlife with a great zoom then 60-300 mm VR lens from nikon is great though slightly expensive at about 26000/- .  Finally, it's the person behind the camera who makes the difference and this camera will not be wanting in features and options to achieve great shots.",

I would suggest for the person who's buying it, that the kit lens is really good. You would definitely want to buy a 35mm f/1.8 lens(Since its a DX camera its better to go for 35 instead of 50mm) for the Bokeh effect to take great images of objects up close or portraits because the kit lens is not really great at producing bokeh because of the aperture limitations. Bokeh is the effect which makes the background appear blurred out. As an Indian, and if you're someone who's bought an entry level DSLR like this one, definitely go for the other lens for the portraits it will make a huge difference in the photographs you'll take.What the kit lens will do for you, however, is take great images. Honestly 18-55 is rock solid stuff. This lens is really really good and its a steal if you go for the kit lens+body.The video quality is through the roof. For the price I've paid I'm really really satisfied with my camera.Good luck shooting!PS: I'm tagging some photos that I personally took in the last 2 days after I received this camera. These are all in JPEG format.This is the absolute best camera in this price range. Don't think twice about this, just go for it. :)",

I got the product for 28990. since I have been waiting quite sometime, and the price currently is this, i had no choice but to buy.This means the price you see on ordering may not remain the same as the price you get in delivery which is rather strange.2) the kit clearly says 8 gb card included. the box and all were completely sealed ( i checked them myself) but the memory card is just not there.any help will be sincerely appreciated.for the camera 5/5 (i could give a 6/5 :P)the best camera you could buy for the money. definitely better than the d5200. apart from the extra 1 point dynamic range, it is the same thing as far as sensor and all go. plus you get all the advanced features of the d5200 the most time saving one being the automatic distortion control. just download the latest firmware and it will take in any lens you could possibly put on it.advise is add a uvc filter and invest in a lens hood.the automatic hdr on 5200 is crap. if you really are into HDR photography you will have to take multiple shots and merge them on your computer to get proper effects.same goes for landscape (which the d3300 has and d5200 does not).plus the 3300 takes 700 plus hots compared to the 5200 which takes 500 odd shots (and yes i have used both).if you cant afford a leica, or if you are cagey about buying the fuji x, this is the smallest, lightest camera with no oplf filter (sharper images) that you can buy India for under 30000 for street photography. Pair it up with a 35mm 1.8 nikon for more light control. 5fps shooting is more than enough unless you are doing very serious sports photography.",

So I contacted Amazon and they asked me to order a new one from amazon, for which the amount will be refunded, if the order is amazon fulfilled. But I couldn't find any seller for the charger which is amazon fulfilled. So I contacted Amazon again and they said they can give 2000 rupees refund, but that will break my EMI. Also the product was costing around 2800 rupees and in that case I will have to shell out 800 rupees from my pocket. So the last option was to return the entire product, but I was not interested in that option as I was travelling the very next day and wanted to use the Camera. Finally Amazon said they are helpless and can't do anything in this case. I am feeling very bad about my purchase from Amazon now.",

All the items listed were inside the box. I ordered it from Cloudtail. I was able to register camera and the lens in Nikon website. Warranty card was available in the box without seller stamp. I did not verify from Nikon Service center though reg warranty.About the cam,This is my first DSLR, and i think i did the right thing choosing this 3300.Latest model, good mega pixel (24mp), Good low light performance (less noise), high dynamic range (darker and brighter in same image), great video quality, decent battery. Simply no regrets. I referred many youtube training videos and pdf about photography. I really could not stop using the cam almost every second day just to try out every technique out there, and its really fun throughout. D3300 simply shines in every department.I too checked and very confused between Canon and Nikon.I referred snapsort.com to compare and choose D3300 over 1200D, 600D, 700D. Nothing seems to come in the way of D3300 other than D5200.Between Canon and Nikon, clear difference is builtin auto focus motor in canon which makes lens price cheaper compare to 3300.If one asks me, i would say choose the brand which you would want to permanently get associated to. Cause neither way you are going to miss anything. Generally when upgrading one would stick to same brand. Nikon has everything Canon has with respect to family of lenses/cameras and vice versa. If your 1st DSLR may not be your last go for wither canon or nikon. If it is ur last, then close your eyes and go for D3300.",

I like to click pictures, be it of Birds or Peoples. So finally when I put some of my month savings to buy a DSLR, I searched various online sites reading the reviews of several DSLR. And finally I decided to buy the NIKON D3300. And trust me, right now, after using the camera for around 4 months, I proudly announce that I'm happy with my decision. There are other company's camera available in the market but within a range of 30000 you can't get a better camera than NIKON D3300.With excellent features, this camera is worth your buck. I'm using a 18-55mm lens (bought with the camera) and the pictures I click are awesome. I entered the world of Digital Images with the help of this Camera. Meanwhile my passion turned into professionalism and nowadays I click pictures at various wedding events. That makes me earn some money too. Now it's time to buy an upgraded lens. So I'm ending my review here and going to check the Amazon site for lenses.P.S. I'm sharing some of my clicks so that you can know the quality of the camera.",

            "review_text": "This item is very well packed by amazon shipping. overall item appears new and in sealed pack. But after checking in detail I found some grease /oil/ dust on Lens mirror, that also appears on viewfinder. As a newbie i didn't take any risk to clean it by myself. And this also something I was not expecting from a NEW Camera. So 4/5 star.Took some test images and videos, which came out good. After playing with for a week, here are the things would like to recommend to new buyers to considerRecommendation :18-55mm lens kit is something you need to upgrade instantly (you will notice its limitation just in a week after taking some shots). Must have 50mm prime lens and 18-104mm lens (under 20K budget).Also upgrade to 32GB Class10 SD card. For any HD /RAW files 8GB is very limited. For 8GB you can take max 260 RAW only Images or 30-40 min Video @ 1080 60FPS.Also have Nikon Remote Shutter , which you can get under 200 bucks. Not necessary to go for Branded one.Go for D5300 over D3300 Why?I found that D5300 support HDR and Timer (Time-laps settings) and it has 39 focus pt. All these 3 features really matters to explore some more creativity. Also Fold-able LCD does helps at many case, mostly When you are Recording Videos.Adobe Lightroom 5 supports Nikon DSLR tethering only upto D5XXX series. It doesn't support for D3XXX series. Which is important, because I am more into Product Photography. So Live view helps a lot to get better images, also save time for post processing work.Wifi n GPS does sounds good, but remember theses two are also power hungry. But it also give you some additional feature to control with your Smartphone. If you are a traveler-blogger, Wifi-GPS can give you good experience.So spending on a D5300 body only with 15000 bucks can give you more reliable DSLR camera, that you can use for 2-3 years. I am going to upgrade to D5300 or D5500 in next 2-3 months, So I could have easily save 30 grand , if some mention theses things earlier.-Chinmay",

My first impression on Nikon D3300 ( again I am not a professional), it has lot of manual keys/buttons, settings which are mostly mechanical. especially the multi-selector wheel is so manual. definitely there is a lot of room of automation. Otherwise, this Camera looks like power packed and has many functions and shootings modes. I was hesitant to but D5200 but definitely the flip-out screen is great feature. eg. when taking pictures on D3300, my nose keep touching the LiveView screen leaving lot of smudges. With flip-out screen it would be very easy......Anyways, I am yet to explore this camera fully and hopefully my next experience is going to be a lot better.",

            "review_text": "All my first dslr research ends here.Guys before buying this cam ,I searched a lot so this review can save a lot of your time and confusions.First thing,for all those who are scared of buying slr online: Yes,your fear is right but not with trusted sellers on Amazon.Nikon clearly says they will not cover warranty for products sold online from some E-commerce sites ,even i got scared but I did complete research on this.I got this camera from a seller CloudTail . Guys if you google you will find he is the biggest seller on Amazon India or you can say amazon India mostly belongs to him.2.Then i carefully checked amazon policies regarding returns.They even pay the money back in case of faulty products where orders are Amazon fulfilled so toattly relax there.3.I checked this cam from Nikon office in Gurgaon.They confirmed he is their authorized seller and the product is totally genuine and also I was able to register it on Nikon.Guys please beware that registration does not mean covered in warranty.Please keep the warranty cards and bill with you to seek warranty if required.Now yes review of the camera: Those who are confused between NikonD3200 or Nikon D5100.Just dont go for D5100 now.Its an oldie now (older processor,slow speed) ,if you say tilt screen,I must say if you think this an advantage ,please dont buy an slr go for point and shoot.If you really like to do photography ,tilt screen is no use at all.You may go for Nikon D3200 is you have a price constraint as most of the features are similar.I have used bot and also talked to nikon expert he simply asked me to go for Nikon D3300 because its the latest one ,has a new processor ,has better image quality.and trust me guys its true.This cam feels a mid level slr.is fast ,superb image quality,Kit lens is good but I would recommed a 35mm prime coz its awsm.I wish you best of luck and happy Buying from Amazon.",

Just wait for their sale and discount days and surely you will get best deal (i got mine)Product :I did lot of research before buying my first DSLR, even as a beginner in photography i thought bit about future and was concerned that after couple of years (after my skills are improved) i should not feel that my gear has limitations and feel to buy another DSLR, seriously i can't afford that. so i wanted to buy just one camera that works for longer time for me. initially i thought to go for Nikon D7000 as it was semi-pro and expect to work for longer time but after talking to few friends and reading lot many articles on internet i decided to go for this one, the reason is simple, invest more in lens then body, because at the end its lens that makes much of difference then body. all beginner and semi pro DSLRs has cropped sensor, so no matter which one you buy its anyway going to be cropped one.Usage :I used it for couple of weeks now and pictures are satisfactory (at-least for kit lens) i am still to buy new lenses and hope to improve in results, but my quest for getting best shots are not limited by kit lens, its good lens and i am happy with it. the camera is good, low in weight good to handle the functions are just rightly placed (read the user's manual first) so it makes it a perfect camera for shooting,Cons : before purchase i forgot to check that this camera does not have inbuilt Auto Focus motor,the advantage of having auto focus motor is that you can buy lens that does not have auto focus (lens with autofocus starts with AF-S) the lens without auto focus motor are cheaper then with auto focus, so i was bit disappointed but i think when you are buying budget gadgets you need to understand & live with its limitations.overall its good (till date). let's see what happens in future...",

Other options considered were Canon EOS 1200 and Nikon D 5200.It has all the features you would need, 16 focal points are enough, don't need too many, LCD does not tilt but I am fine with that, how much do you need it? It has no wifi or GPS but no big deal again. It has lots of functions and gives you a versatile SLR for a reasonable price. The basic kit lens came at a bargain price. You can add a lens or two as you start using the camera. I added 1.8 mm nikon prime lens to begin with for low light performance. If you want a lens for wildlife with a great zoom then 60-300 mm VR lens from nikon is great though slightly expensive at about 26000/- .  Finally, it's the person behind the camera who makes the difference and this camera will not be wanting in features and options to achieve great shots.",

They suggested that if you are looking for long term investment buy canon (lenses are cheaper/value for money) and other wise whatever you buy does not matter until you know how to click. Canon v/s Nikon is all about which camera model you are buying. There are some good models released by Canon and same by Nikon too for beginners (entry level)/mid level/professional. Now question is that which camera you want to buy?I wanted an entry level DSLR.....and after many research i bought Canon 1200D with 18-55 and 55-250 Lens Kit at the 21000 i clicked it for a day. result were depressing. Thanks to amazon,in, i returned it and again bought Nikon D3300@26249 with 18-55 kit. and it is much better and and more than that what i wanted in my Camera. the only things which lacking is the  \"tilt screen\" which gives flexibility.Well friends..if you will read reviews you will find that many people compare it with less auto focus points, censor size, brackets, sensitivity, ISO noise, wi fi,  etc. But i tell you one thing that its not the function which makes things look good it is your inside artist. angles, sides, positions, background, morning/evening session, lighting.I am still learning my Nikon D3300 and it is producing best images same what i wanted. Now I am planning to buy Nikon 50 mm 1.8 lens.So friends in simple words buy Nikon D3300 and it will not disappoint you.",

But for those new to DSLR photography, Nikon did a great job of including automatic, easy to use features with this camera too.One feature aimed at those new to DSLR photography is the Nikon D3300\u2019s Guide mode. The Guide explains the camera\u2019s features on the screen as you activate them, and it even can help you make changes to the D3300\u2019s settings when you want to perform certain tasks. This type of on-screen help mode simply isn\u2019t found on advanced cameras or other DSLR cameras, which makes the D3300 a great camera for inexperienced photographers, either those new to digital photography or those new to DSLR photography.As with most DSLR cameras, you can shoot in two modes with the D3300 \u2014 Live View and viewfinder modes. This Nikon model works fast when you\u2019re in viewfinder mode, providing minimal shutter lag and shot to shot delays. But if you switch to Live View mode, where you frame the scene using the LCD screen like you would with one of the best point and shoot cameras, the shutter lag can be 1 second or more. Be prepared to be ticked off occasionally over this camera\u2019s sluggishness in Live View mode when you miss a photo because of shutter lag or long shot to shot delays.The D3300 also only offers an 11-point autofocus system, which ranks behind most other DSLR cameras and explains some of this camera\u2019s slow performance in Live View mode.When considering DSLR cameras, be sure to look at the Nikon D3300 against a Nikon D5300, where you\u2019ll find the D5300 has a higher price point by almost $200. And the Nikon D3300 vs. D5300 comparison also shows that the D5300 has some desirable features, including a tiltable LCD screen and built-in WiFi. One way Nikon keeps the D3300 DSLR at a lower price point is by not offering those features.IMAGE QUALITYNikon designed the D3300 DSLR around an APS-C image sensor with 24.2 megapixels of resolution, which results in very good image quality. The D3300\u2019s image quality surpasses most of the models you\u2019ll find in this price range.Another feature of this model that leads to great image quality is that Nikon removed the anti-aliasing filter from the image sensor. Although you run the risk of seeing a moire pattern without an anti-aliasing filter, this is a rare problem with modern image sensors. So manufacturers are removing this filter more often to allow for sharper images, and it works well with the D3300.When comparing the D3300 to a Nikon D5500 review, you\u2019ll see both cameras have almost an identical image sensor, both in terms of physical size and in the number of megapixels of resolution, allowing the image quality of the two cameras to remain somewhat similar. But the D5500\u2019s price point is nearly double that of the D3300, because it contains a host of extra features, such as a touchscreen LCD and a tilting LCD.LOW LIGHT PERFORMANCE AND MOVIE MODENikon D3300 DSLR reviewPlenty of control buttons allow you to easily make changes to the D3300\u2019s settings.Against comparable cameras, the Nikon D3300 DSLR works very well in low light photography situations. Incorrect pixels (called noise) are minimal in dark scenes, whether you choose to use the D3300\u2019s popup flash unit or to increase the ISO setting close to the camera\u2019s maximum native setting of 12800. (An extended ISO setting of 25600 is available too, but it does provide quite a bit of noise.) You also can add an external flash to the camera\u2019s hot shoe.With full-time autofocus, the D3300\u2019s movie recording capabilities are stronger than other entry-level DSLRs. You\u2019ll have access to full HD recording with the Nikon D3300 at up to 60 frames per second, which is above average performance against similarly priced models.BATTERY LIFEBattery life is one area where the D3300 easily wins a Nikon D3300 vs. Canon T5i comparison. Nikon estimates that the D3300 can record up to 700 photos per battery charge, whereas the T5i is rated for up to 440 shots per charge.Keep in mind that those battery life estimates are primarily for using these DSLR cameras in viewfinder mode and not Live View mode. Testing shows that using Live View mode causes the battery life to be about half for the D3300 of what you\u2019ll receive by using the camera primarily in viewfinder mode.WRAP UPDSLR cameras can be expensive, especially when you add in the costs of extra gear beyond the camera body, such as lenses and flash units. So if you need a versatile DSLR camera at a low price point, the Nikon D3300 DSLR is a great option. It provides 24.2 megapixels of resolution and very good image quality, which is great to find in a DSLR camera under $500. When matching this model against its predecessor, the Nikon D3300 vs. D3200 comparison shows the D3300 has longer battery life and better low light image quality, both of which are desirable features. The D3300 has a good form factor and a slightly lighter camera body than the D3200 too, meaning those who own the older camera may find that an upgrade to the D3300 \u2014 which made our best DSLR cameras list \u2014 is a smart idea.",

            "review_text": "I have done quite a bit of research. The value for money for entry level cams (nikon and cannon) are 200% (200 value for 100 bucks). The sensor used in this cam is a crop 24MP sensor which is the same as any mid level Nikon DSLR. The only place where it loses out is the fine tuning which the costlier variants possess. Interesting fact is the kit lens that comes with the cam doesn't even fully utilize the camera sensor to it's maximum abilities. You need to buy a costlier lens to fully appreciate the sensor capabilities.In total, I'd say the sensor is excellent. Although you migh lag in other fancy features that not that important if your new to photography.If your new to photography, I'd suggest you to read lots of articles by searching different tags and have a good understanding about the kinds of camera that are available and what suits you the best. See a lot of youtube videos as well.Don't just blindly invest money into something that you don't know. First learn and then come to a conclusive decision.I am a beginner and for an entry level camera, I found this to be most suitable for me.",

            "review_text": "I purchased this camera for the purpose of having a great travel camera, and a \"go to\" camera when I don't feel like lugging along a lot of equipment. The image quality is superb. Where the D3300 really excels over the 3100 & 3200 is the ISO range. It takes beautiful shots in lower natural lighting situations, but realize that the lens has something to do with this as well. There were some complaints about the camera, but again, I believe this to be due to the limitations of the included kit lens (which has a limited range of aperture & depth of field). The settings on the camera can only go so far as the lens allows. It would be best to match your lens with the type(s) of photography you like to do rather than expecting the camera to work like a point and shoot. As far as the image processing and video the camera performs very well. Nikon D3300 is very easy to use, and would be a perfect entry level camera for the anyone not familiar with DSLRs. There are tons of features with this camera, and some interesting modes for certain effects that are quite simply fun & easy for anyone to use. If you'd like the ease of a point and shoot camera yet want much more professional looking and beautiful images, this is the camera for you. Realize that you may need lenses (prime, longer range zoom, or macro) to get the most from this camera, that's up to you in choosing what matches your needs. Personally, I'd purchase it again in a heartbeat, and am looking forward to using it during my travels and the holidays. I'm very pleased. Highly recommended!",

After a brief research on internet sites, D3300 came out as a better alternative. You can google if you want to compare features/results. For me it was a long term investment and so I wanted it to be wise. I was keen with picture quality and low light capabilities. D3300 seemed to deliver that. I also bought 55-200 mm at 7.5k & 35 mm prime at 7.5k. And at this price, these were icing on the cake!After getting my hands over it, I shot a very low light scene using 55-200 mm lens from about 20ft, at 12,800 ISO with 10 seconds exposure without flash. The grains were acceptable for me. Same shot at 100 ISO, 13 seconds was fabulous and it was difficult to identify for anyone whether it was a day shot or a night shot.Recently, I shot an event in my office with my new DSLR. With couple of other DSLRs around, the photos by D3300 were far better!I am not a professional to evaluate this product professionally. I'm still exploring the camera features and learning.

I like to click pictures, be it of Birds or Peoples. So finally when I put some of my month savings to buy a DSLR, I searched various online sites reading the reviews of several DSLR. And finally I decided to buy the NIKON D3300. And trust me, right now, after using the camera for around 4 months, I proudly announce that I'm happy with my decision. There are other company's camera available in the market but within a range of 30000 you can't get a better camera than NIKON D3300.With excellent features, this camera is worth your buck. I'm using a 18-55mm lens (bought with the camera) and the pictures I click are awesome. I entered the world of Digital Images with the help of this Camera. Meanwhile my passion turned into professionalism and nowadays I click pictures at various wedding events. That makes me earn some money too. Now it's time to buy an upgraded lens. So I'm ending my review here and going to check the Amazon site for lenses.P.S. I'm sharing some of my clicks so that you can know the quality of the camera.",
