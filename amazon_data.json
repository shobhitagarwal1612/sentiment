            "review_text": "First of all good service from Amazon.in, timely delivery before the expected date. Coming to the product, this is my first DSLR and I have researched online for at least 3 months before getting into a conclusion. It is by far the best among the beginners level DSLR in the 25-45k range. Got confused whether to buy\u00a0Nikon D3300\u00a0or\u00a0Nikon D5200\u00a0but chose this one due to better ISO and faster processor and newer version. I am using this camera since almost 2 months now and after using this I am shocked how can a beginners DSLR give performance like this.Before heading into the review, I would like to mention the contents of the box.\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bfIN THE BOX:\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf Nikon D3300 Body, with body cap.\u29bf Nikkor AF-S 18-55 mm f/3.5-5.6 VR II Kit Lens.\u29bf EN-EL14a Li-ion Battery, with a terminal cover.\u29bf MH-24 Battery Charger.\u29bf UC-E17 Data Transfer USB Cable.\u29bf EG-CP14 AV cable.\u29bf Nikon Strap.\u29bf View NX2 CD-ROM.\u29bf User Manual.\u29bf Warranty Card x 2  1. Two years Warranty Card with the serial Number of the Camera  2. One year International Warranty Card with the serial number of the lens  [Note: Though the two warranty cards comes with either one of the serial numbers, that does not mean it is only applicable to the lens or  camera only, both the warranty cards are applicable to both camera body and lens. Another thing the other accessories are not covered  under any warranty]\u29bf 8 GB SD Card (Taped outside the box)\u29bf Nikon DSLR Camera Bag\u29bf Two Nikon School CDs and one invitation. (Received it as a offer, may not be applicable in your case)[Note the camera does not come with an Accessory Hot-Shoe Cover, unlike other models, so you have to buy it separately, if you need to protect your hot-shoe, it costs around 35 INR in normal camera shop.]\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714PROS:\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714 The Sensor: Well o well, the 24 MP sensor that you get in this camera is the same one as that of the\u00a0Nikon D7100\u00a0and\u00a0Nikon D5300\u00a0which speaks much of the picture quality you are going to get with this camera. The sensor has a total pixel density of 24.78 pixels, which result in images having much details, while sacrificing the low light performance a bit.\u2714 The camera comes with a faster and more improved processor, the Expeed 4 Processing Engine which lets the camera to process images and especially videos faster than the older models. This is the main reason why the camera's got faster frame rates than the predecessors.\u2714 The camera does not come with OLPF(Optical Low Pass Filter) which results in significantly sharper images. Nikon is doing a new upgrade in their cameras nowadays i.e, they are removing the Low Pass Filter, so as a result, the camera can now capture both types of light i.e, with shorter wavelength and longer wavelength which ultimately makes the images much more sharper.\u2714 The camera has a 11 point focus system, which is awesome for a camera at this price tag. You get a single cross type focus point in the middle and other 10 normal focus points surrounding the frame. This 11 focus points can do a fast auto focus while paired up with a good lens and it also has 3D tracking functionality. This 11 points are also very helpful and fast responsive during manual focusing.\u2714 The ISO performance is very good for a beginner's DSLR at 12800 and a boost ISO of 25600. More importantly this camera has low noise at 1385 ISO which is awesome. But try to avoid ISO more than 3200 until it is a pitch black scene, because that would produce much noise in the images.\u2714 The battery backup is also great, 700 shots is very much unexpected from a camera of this configuration but Nikon seems to have got it right. The EN-EL14a battery is an upgraded version of the EN-EL14 battery which used to come with the\u00a0Nikon D3200\u00a0and it has increased mAh and efficient power handling.\u2714 The kit lens is very good and it has a much faster auto-focus than the predecessor and is also much compact and lighter. Most importantly the lens comes with VR II motor, which is very useful for a beginner having problems to hold the camera still at earlier stages of photography. It keeps that 52 mm filter thread so no worries for ones who have 52 mm filter from your old lenses, you can use them on this.\u2714 1080p 60fps, now this is a big deal, even some of the advanced DSLRs can't go that far but this does. Very helpful if you need to shoot action. I have been shooting fast action videos with lag free performance at 1080p 60 fps, thanks to the faster new Expeed 4 processor, which has a super fast processing speed.\u2714 You get 5fps 24.0MP RAW files which is awesome but you need a good and faster card for that the offered card can't keep up with that speed. Well a good recommendation and in fact the best card will be\u00a0SanDisk Extreme Pro, it offers fantastic write speed of 72.8mbps for this camera and the buffer never clicks in if you shoot at burst mode using this card, just you have to keep in mind that the shutter needs to be pressed after every 100 shots to continue burst shooting.\u2714 The camera has a good colour depth of 24.3 bits which produces vivid colours on the images and you can see the effect of those 24.3 bits during post processing.\u2714 The camera comes with a 3 inch 921k dots LCD display, which may not be the best monitor in the world, but certainly it is bright enough and produces vivid colours close to real world view.\u2714 Easy Panaroma mode -  Now it is like a bonus though you hardly need it, but handy at times. Remember you are capturing a panaroma from a DSLR so the picture would be much much better than what you may take with phones.\u2714 Very compact camera. It does not seem like a DSLR if you hold it in your palm, it is so compact and light. The camera only weighs about 450 g (without the battery), which is super light when you are talking about a DSLR of this performance.\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718CONS:\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718 The ISO can be used at one full stop, so you can't get the 1/3rd or 1/2nd stop ISO at manual mode, but you get that in auto mode, that is may be something Nikon has not made due to simplicity for beginners, but that is not so great a deal due to good ISO performance of this camera.\u2718 The camera can shoot only 12 bit RAW files, unlike 14 bits in the Nikon D5xxx series, which although produces great image quality, but that extra elegance goes somewhere missing. Though you can hardly notice that until you shoot it at 14 bits RAW and compare the two.\u2718 No articulating screen, this is something that would have been better to have for shooting at tricky situations, but that also would have raised the price. But personally I did not give that much priority. Also in professional DSLRs you hardly get that articulating screen.That said the cons are not that big deal considering the price of this camera and that it is build focusing mostly for the beginners.\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8VERDICT:\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8Overall a wonderful camera to be owned. The camera bag offered is also fair enough. Many of us think that camera does the job, if we have good camera we can get good images but that is not the thing, a photographer makes the photograph unique not the camera. Yes, there are some limitations but still that is not that important for good shots. This camera just has more features compared to counterparts from Canon or Sony, or any other company at the same price point but that is not a great deal for photography, this is just a bit advanced. Well I have attached some shots taken with the camera and the camera itself. Thank you for reading this much. I will update the review after more usage in depth. Please hit Yes if you found my review helpful, if not then you can comment on the review with your issue and I will definitely help you. Happy Shopping!!!",

            "review_posted_date": "19 September 2016", 
            "review_text": "Nikon has released a new kit lens in 2016 that is compatible with D3300. There are various kit lenses before it. This is what you need to understand :AF- S 18-55mm VR - oldestAF- S 18-55mm VR II - oldAF- P 18-55mm VR- latestThe \"P\" stands for a stepping motor, a newer technology which makes the lens significantly quieter (almost silent) and slightly faster. The new lens has also slightly better performance at wide open settings. And it has VR- Vibration Reduction for image stabilization. You can read the Ken Rockwell review of this lens.I've seen many people being angry at the seller for sending them the AF-P VR lens which is the latest, complaining that they did not get the VR II lens. You should be actually thanking them for sending you the latest lens and not the old one.The new Kit lens requires a firmware update for Nikon D3300( V1.01). But the orders placed now and afterwards will receive cameras with the latest firmware inbuilt.About the camera, you know its the best. Splendid image quality equivalent to higher end Nikon DX cameras. So even if you buy the D7200, there wouldn't be a big difference in image quality. The controls n features change.Reasons why you might want to consider Canon 1200D(1300D has no worthy improvement) :1) You want DSLR quality photos. Nikon just does it better. But Canon's still a DSLR with a big sensor. Great photos there too.2) If you don't shoot RAW or if you don't post process your photos, get the Canon. (This is where Nikon's sensor really shines, at getting the fine details back)3) You will get the 2 lens option with Canon under 23K (on good seasons) and that second lens is a  55-250mm IS II. A very good telephoto lens. So if you're not going to buy another lens at all, Canon has a better deal.4) Canon lenses are usually cheaper. Like the 50mm f1.8 portrait lens. Nikon cost 10,000 INR while Canon's variant is around or below 8000 INR.5)Canon has a very cheap wide lens, the 10-18mm. Nikon doesn't !Canon Cons :1) No amazing sensor. Canon's sensor is smaller in size too. Hence less efficient. But still capable of DSLR quality images. Nikon takes better shots under low light.2) Not for video lovers. No mic jack on Canon. Does not do 60fps which is required for slow mo. Nikon has a mic jack for clear external audio and it does 60fps too.3) Nikon is smaller and lighter.4) Battery. Nikon has double the battery capability compared to Canon.Both have no touch screen nor a screen that tilts. The Kit lens that comes with Nikon is significantly better than Canon's. So it takes great pictures. Sample shots can be seen at Pixelpeeper or Flickr.And yes, the kits lens can blur the background at 55mm f5.6.Lenses to buy afterwards, if you're serious about photography :1) Nikon AF P 70-300 VR. Stabilized lens for 14-15k is a great deal. Autofocus is really fast but the aperture at 300mm is 6.3. So it would struggle a bit under low light situations. A major wildlife photographer needs something like the Tamron 150-600mm lens.2) Nikon 35mm f1.8G. An all around amazing lens. This lens makes you a better photographer. Fixed prime, meaning no zoom. But unmatched image quality at this price. Great for indoor shots too.3) A wide angle lens. Expensive Tokina 11-16mm.4) If portraits are a big deal to you, only then go for the 50mm f1.8 G.Overall an amazing camera. You cannot go wrong with this one. Just make sure you really need a DSLR and its features. If you're someone who needs better images than smartphones with a good flash, better portability and going to shoot in Auto Mode anyway, you're looking for a point and shoot camera and the new ones takes great pictures under good light.",

            "review_text": "I always had questions in my mind why i need a DSLR? i already have phone and a high megapixel digital camera.But the deal amazon was providing for this product was great, so i did some research and decided to buy this product.To begin with delivery package was very good it had everything to protect my device during logistics.Everything was as described in description of this product.When i initially held the device in my hand i was overwhelmed by number of buttons, for initial few hours i was using auto mode and results were not upto the expectations. but when i view the Tutorial session(of 80 mins) which was provided with package, it was only then i was able to understand the feature of each button and technicality of product. overall it is very easy to learn about utilizing the DSLR to its full capacity.So if you have hands on experience with DSLR then you will love this (at this price), if you are a newbie even then you will love this (although it has 90 mins of learning curve).Deducting 1 start as it did not have a HDR feature inbuilt, as it is manufactured in 2014 so it was expected out of it. apart from that it has everything to offer what you expect from a DSLR.It is worth every penny you invested to keep your memories alive forever. :)",

            "review_text": "General Observations about Amazon, packaging & warrantyProduct ordered on 15th Oct --- Delivered on 29th Oct....!!!Packaging was very good.No dealer stamp on warranty and Bill doesnt contain product number which may be a problem for warranty, have to clarify with amazon regarding this, Before purchase i asked them about warranty and they have assured if u buy from Amazon fulfilled supplier amazon will give warranty even if nikon does not gives thats when i decided to buy online since it was 6k cheaper than authorized dealers which will save u money to buy an extra lens!!!Now about the Nikon masterpiece D3300Before buying any expensive product online it is mandatory for us all to do a research about the competetion and available products within our budget. Please compare the available products in ur price range only like u can not compare D3300 with a DSLR costing 55K...It will come down to Canon 1200D with zoom lens kit, D3200, D5200 and Canon 600D.All between 26-32k range. Nikon D3100 & Canon 1100D etc are old models and are still cheaper so i didnt considered them.Being a first DSLR hands down almost 99% of google recommemds D3300. I went to Nikon and Canon dealers and checked all models in this budget. heres why i went for D3300 & the after experience :1) It offers u latest processor and sensor with VR-II kit lens.2) The Battery Life is Best in its class with remarkable nos ahead from the competetion and i felt the same after using it.3) Its really very handy and small compared to D5200, only thing 5200 has a tilt screen but i felt it will not make that much difference, for fitting a tilt screen the size of the camera becomes large. I read a lot since my final two models were 5200 and 3300 and felt that the latest processor and better battery life and a diff of 6k for D3300 will be good for my requirements. Since nowhere u can find exceptional difference between image quality of the two cameras. HDR u will hardly require and tilt screen for me was not a priority.4) The image quality is superb. it has a child mode which is very useful when u dont have time for manual settings. Auto mode produces fine images when u dont have time for settings.5) Comes with 8GB card which will be sufficient for few months till u conquer all skills of photography.6) Bag is ok but not very stylish. Can accomodate an extra lens easily.7) Camera is very very fast, first time users will fall in love with the speed of the camera absolutely no lags anywhere.8) Photograps in low light and indoor pics at evening or night time are also very impressive. Flash does an excellent job.9) Colour reproduction is superb, if u click vegetables and look on HDTV they look way better than they look in real life :)...10) I was not used to click pics through view finder so i thought live view is a very useful feature for a DSLR but in real life u will  hardly use live view once u get ur hands on unless a position where u cant put ur head below the cam, even with specks it is  very easy to shoot using view finder .11) LCD screen is very good. With high resolution screen u can judge the quality of image immediatly after clicking which is difficult if  the LCD resolution is low.12) Nikon website is very informative and helps a lot u can register for nikon school and refer tutorials.13) Canon 1200D with Kit lens & zoom lens is a very tough competetion since Nikon D3300 with similar zoom lens is 10K more but  after a lot of reading from websites and reviews u will find that for image quality nikon is a clear winner at entry level DSLR by a  far margin. Kit lens will fulfil most of ur photography requirements initially, wait till u discover urself what lens u really require  before going on to purchase the combo pack with zoom lens.  Hence i decided to buy D3300 and leave the zoom lens in to be bought further category.14) It takes a little time for autofocus at night in very low light but it is ok otherwise autofocus in all other conditions is excellent.  captures fast moving objects in the frame perfectly.15) Manual supplied in the box is useful, and should be read first if u r using a DSLR for the first time.16) It has a wifi feature which may b useful for clicking pics using ur smart phone but requires u to purchase a dongle.It feels excellent to click from this cam because of its fine ergonomics, small size and light weight. its a worth investment. Its a long road in learning and mastering the techniques in photography, with nikon u will enjoy learing it coz when u do it right it delivers excellent results.... just remember a quote which i like very much :\"\"\" Buying a Nikon doesnt makes u a photographer... it only makes u the owner of the Nikon Camera...\"\"\"So keep learning....",

            "review_text": "D3300 takes beautiful images. I just can't seem to take my hands off it. Now it might be because its pretty new to me, but the images it takes are really beautiful. I would suggest for the person who's buying it, that the kit lens is really good. You would definitely want to buy a 35mm f/1.8 lens(Since its a DX camera its better to go for 35 instead of 50mm) for the Bokeh effect to take great images of objects up close or portraits because the kit lens is not really great at producing bokeh because of the aperture limitations. Bokeh is the effect which makes the background appear blurred out. As an Indian, and if you're someone who's bought an entry level DSLR like this one, definitely go for the other lens for the portraits it will make a huge difference in the photographs you'll take.What the kit lens will do for you, however, is take great images. Honestly 18-55 is rock solid stuff. This lens is really really good and its a steal if you go for the kit lens+body.The video quality is through the roof. For the price I've paid I'm really really satisfied with my camera.Good luck shooting!PS: I'm tagging some photos that I personally took in the last 2 days after I received this camera. These are all in JPEG format.This is the absolute best camera in this price range. Don't think twice about this, just go for it. :)",

I would have rated it a 5 on 5 except for some issues-1) when i had ordered the camera it was listed at 28400 or thereabouts. I got the product for 28990. since I have been waiting quite sometime, and the price currently is this, i had no choice but to buy.This means the price you see on ordering may not remain the same as the price you get in delivery which is rather strange.2) the kit clearly says 8 gb card included. the box and all were completely sealed ( i checked them myself) but the memory card is just not there.any help will be sincerely appreciated.for the camera 5/5 (i could give a 6/5 :P)the best camera you could buy for the money. definitely better than the d5200. apart from the extra 1 point dynamic range, it is the same thing as far as sensor and all go. plus you get all the advanced features of the d5200 the most time saving one being the automatic distortion control. just download the latest firmware and it will take in any lens you could possibly put on it.advise is add a uvc filter and invest in a lens hood.the automatic hdr on 5200 is crap. if you really are into HDR photography you will have to take multiple shots and merge them on your computer to get proper effects.same goes for landscape (which the d3300 has and d5200 does not).plus the 3300 takes 700 plus hots compared to the 5200 which takes 500 odd shots (and yes i have used both).if you cant afford a leica, or if you are cagey about buying the fuji x, this is the smallest, lightest camera with no oplf filter (sharper images) that you can buy India for under 30000 for street photography. Pair it up with a 35mm 1.8 nikon for more light control. 5fps shooting is more than enough unless you are doing very serious sports photography.",

            "review_text": "It\u2019s odd to think how quickly camera technology can pass from the realm of the pro to the amateur, from cutting-edge to pass\u00e9. Once upon a time we were all astounded by the 24.5MP resolution of the Nikon D3X, a camera designed for professional photographers who were willing to spend \u00a34200 on their gear. Four years later and some people might reasonably be disappointed that the entry-level \u00a3500 Nikon D3300 'only' carries the same 24.2MP resolution as its direct predecessor the D3200. How things change.Despite the identical resolutions of the Nikon D3300 and D3200, there is one very important difference that impacts image quality. For the D3300, Nikon has removed the optical anti-aliasing filter. This is a filter installed in digital cameras to reduce occurrences of optical aberrations such as moir\u00e9 patterning \u2013 unwanted artifacts appearing on images that feature repetitive detail patterns. While anti-aliasing filters reduce this effect, the cost is a loss in sharpness. Recently it has become a trendy move for camera manufacturers to remove the filters entirely in favour of optimal sharpness, relying on big megapixel counts to cope with any moir\u00e9-causing patterns.The effect for a camera like the D3300 is that its high-resolution sensor is now able to capture every possible detail, putting it in the same league with more advanced (and more expensive) cameras. And with that, things get more interesting.NIKON D3300 VS D3200: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?The resolution may be the same as the D3200, but the D3300 has plenty of other improvements under the bonnet. Chief among these is the new Expeed 4 image-processing engine. Nikon\u2019s fastest processor yet, it improves the D3300\u2019s ISO sensitivity to an impressive maximum of 25,600 and its shooting rate to 5fps \u2013 not top of the league but very impressive for an entry-level camera. There are also a few new automatic flash modes, including an option for fill flash.It\u2019s worth noting that there is plenty that remains the same from the previous model in the series. You\u2019ve got an 11-point AF system, a 3-inch 921k-dot rear screen and a 420 pixel RGB sensor metering system, all things that D3200 users will find thoroughly familiar. The D3300 shoots images in JPEG and 12-bit Raw formats, and is capable of saving them to SD, SDHC or SDXC memory cards.The D3300 also carries one big absence over from its predecessor: built-in Wi-Fi. While Nikon (finally) introduced built-in wi-fi with the D5300, the technology did not carry over to the D3300, which still relies on the separately available WU-1a adapter. It\u2019s not a huge annoyance, just be aware that you\u2019ll have to shell out an extra \u00a340 or so if you want to use Wi-Fi on your D3300.Elsewhere there are a number of other optional extras on the D3300. You can attach the Nikon GP-1 module to a socket on the side of the camera in order to geotag images. There are also a number of additional shooting modes: a Rangefinder Mode (finding which requires a little digging into the menus); Mirror Lock-Up, though only for sensor cleaning, not for shooting; Easy Panorama, which automatically stitches several images together; and Effects Mode, with visual filters such as high-key and Selective Colour.To pair with the D3300, Nikon unveiled a new retractable kit lens, the F-S DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II lens, an impressively sharp number with a minimum focus distance of 25cm (when manually focusing; 28cm with AF). As the camera lacks a built-in AF motor it requires AF-S lenses in order to be able to autofocus.",

While autofocus performance is a little below average, and the limited external controls and smaller size may be a turn off for some, the D3300 excels in most areas. If you're ready to make the jump to a DSLR camera, the Nikon D3300 provides a nice starting point with a great combination of image quality, ease of use and price.PROSExcellent image quality with lots of fine detail; Very good high ISO performance; Good dynamic range; Good print quality; Deep buffers with JPEGs; 1080/60p video; Uncompressed HDMI output.CONSAF struggles in low-light; Contrast-detect AF in live view is slow; Buffer depth is shallow with RAW files; No AE bracketing; No built-in Wi-Fi.I Hope That You Find It Helpful If Yes So Please Rate It Too..",

            "review_text": "First about amazon experience,Got my 1st DSLR delivered in 4 days after ordering on 8th Aug. Packing was good. And the product was fresh and neat. All the items listed were inside the box. I ordered it from Cloudtail. I was able to register camera and the lens in Nikon website. Warranty card was available in the box without seller stamp. I did not verify from Nikon Service center though reg warranty.About the cam,This is my first DSLR, and i think i did the right thing choosing this 3300.Latest model, good mega pixel (24mp), Good low light performance (less noise), high dynamic range (darker and brighter in same image), great video quality, decent battery. Simply no regrets. I referred many youtube training videos and pdf about photography. I really could not stop using the cam almost every second day just to try out every technique out there, and its really fun throughout. D3300 simply shines in every department.I too checked and very confused between Canon and Nikon.I referred snapsort.com to compare and choose D3300 over 1200D, 600D, 700D. Nothing seems to come in the way of D3300 other than D5200.Between Canon and Nikon, clear difference is builtin auto focus motor in canon which makes lens price cheaper compare to 3300.If one asks me, i would say choose the brand which you would want to permanently get associated to. Cause neither way you are going to miss anything. Generally when upgrading one would stick to same brand. Nikon has everything Canon has with respect to family of lenses/cameras and vice versa. If your 1st DSLR may not be your last go for wither canon or nikon. If it is ur last, then close your eyes and go for D3300.",

            "review_text": "This item is very well packed by amazon shipping. overall item appears new and in sealed pack. But after checking in detail I found some grease /oil/ dust on Lens mirror, that also appears on viewfinder. As a newbie i didn't take any risk to clean it by myself. And this also something I was not expecting from a NEW Camera. So 4/5 star.Took some test images and videos, which came out good. After playing with for a week, here are the things would like to recommend to new buyers to considerRecommendation :18-55mm lens kit is something you need to upgrade instantly (you will notice its limitation just in a week after taking some shots). Must have 50mm prime lens and 18-104mm lens (under 20K budget).Also upgrade to 32GB Class10 SD card. For any HD /RAW files 8GB is very limited. For 8GB you can take max 260 RAW only Images or 30-40 min Video @ 1080 60FPS.Also have Nikon Remote Shutter , which you can get under 200 bucks. Not necessary to go for Branded one.Go for D5300 over D3300 Why?I found that D5300 support HDR and Timer (Time-laps settings) and it has 39 focus pt. All these 3 features really matters to explore some more creativity. Also Fold-able LCD does helps at many case, mostly When you are Recording Videos.Adobe Lightroom 5 supports Nikon DSLR tethering only upto D5XXX series. It doesn't support for D3XXX series. Which is important, because I am more into Product Photography. So Live view helps a lot to get better images, also save time for post processing work.Wifi n GPS does sounds good, but remember theses two are also power hungry. But it also give you some additional feature to control with your Smartphone. If you are a traveler-blogger, Wifi-GPS can give you good experience.So spending on a D5300 body only with 15000 bucks can give you more reliable DSLR camera, that you can use for 2-3 years. I am going to upgrade to D5300 or D5500 in next 2-3 months, So I could have easily save 30 grand , if some mention theses things earlier.-Chinmay",

The sensor is the same, the mega pixel count is the same. Heck D3300 doesn't even have a light filter making each pixel square accept more light. This is advanced DSLR category!I got it at a fantastic price on Amazon. Opted for next day delivery. No probs at all.Went to a 40 day trip to Canada, captured more than 7000 pictures. The images are crisp, color tones perfect, out of the box 'Auto Mode' captures pretty decent (at times even better than manual!) images. Low light performance is also acceptable. Though one needs a bit more practice at low shttee speeds and without a tripod. If you plan to explore night life with this serious camera, you'd definately need a tripod. Otherwise no complains at all. Already feel like I have got my investment's return!I also captured tons of Full HD videos. God the only thing I missed is the image stabilization coz on a 42\" 3D tv the lack of motion soothing is heavily missed. Yet when you know what you're doing, D3300 takes mind boggling videos!The lens along with the kit is the ED VR 18-55 mm Nikkor lens. It does the job perfectly for your day to day photography. But I am just so sure looking at the specs that the D3300 has tons more to offer so planing to by a Prime lens and also a zoom/macro lens in the near future.The party has only just started!",
