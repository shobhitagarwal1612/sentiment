The only drawback i found is its low speaker volume,, but that did not bother me because there is a workaround to increase its volume.. Samsung really working hard to make its touchwiz snappier and this time,, they managed it to be more snappier than pure android. Gaming performance is awesome.. Display is awesome.. I did not liked the earphones.. So i ordered another earphone to use with this.. RAM is less but performance is far better than higher RAM models.. I compared it with moto x play and overall j7 is clear winner.Android 5.1 out of the box. Battery life is awesome compared to rebranded phones in market and no heating issues which is the most common problem in xiomi, yureka, lenovo.. Belive me guys i bought this phone after a lot of reasearch and i bought this phone to give me peace of mind.. I did not wanted my phone to get heat up  everytime i use it for 5 minutes. .Thank you samsung for this great phone and amazon for great offer.Pardon typos...",

Exactly six months after I bought this device, it fell from a height of 3-4 in a softslip and the display went blank. Despite the screen guard in place and no apparent scrack on the screen, this device is now virtually useless. Samsung authorised service centre says it costs 5k and takes 15 days min. to get this working. Obviously they give no warranties calling this a physical damage.",

I bought mine from Samsung retail store so I cannot talk about amazon service for this product.The only problem with J7 is that it does not feature Corning Gorilla glass. But if you get a tampered glass, the phone's screen will be protected from dust and scratches. If you need gorilla glass protection, you might want to buy J7 prime. It has all the features of J7 2015 model except AMOLED display which I think is far better than IPS display in terms of color depth and brightness of the screen.When it comes to gaming performance, this phone is the beast. You can play almost all games on the play store without any lag whatsoever. I have tested following games on my phone with maximum possible graphics settings- NOVA 3, GTA San Andreas, Gangster Vegas, Modern Combat 5.Battery backup on this phone is also very impressive. Once fully charged, you can use it for almost two days with normal use (wifi turned on, phone calls (~2 hours a day), music (~1 hour a day).If you are looking for a budget phone with all the essential features, Galaxy J7 is the right phone for you.",

Camera is not excellent but very good. Features like smart manager and otg support makes it a good deal. Coupled with extended storage, dual sim, 4g LTE,  it is a steal at this price.

Best phone in midrange comparing to xiaomi 4, 4i, moto g3, even moto X This phone is the best phone with amazing superamoled display, Camera, Speed.... everything is perfect in this phone. Dont compare it from ram size because it has octacore processor which is faster as compare to other mid range phones. Speaker volume is less as its not a big issue for me but internal sound is just awesome with headphones(a jays one, recommended) Go for golden colour. It looks awesome.",

Some people are saying it has low volume, it may have slight low volume but I must say it has a quality sound and this is what exactly I want and for me volume is sufficient.Most important: Maximum Samsung smartphones lags too much but this is a unique Samsung product where I can't find any sign of lagging. Fully satisfied with J7. Thanks Samsung for making such phone under 14k.",
