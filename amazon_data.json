Do not support pendrive or data card through otg so only depend on Wifi.  When Wifi is turned on backup is less than 2 hours.  I tried first time to return but no response from amazon.  No contact option to seller. It have hotspot I don't know why because it cannot work with both functions on.Suggestion -  if you want a tab for reading books, newspaper, checking mails, and watching videos with  minimal or say no app or have budget problem (on Wifi only) then go for it but if you want to  use almost everything you can do on pc then avoid it.I am ready to help anyone wants to know anything about it before buying just write below and wait few hours.

No custom skins or interface.No heating issues while normal usage.Cons:The battery drains very quickly, tab will run about 4 hours on internet browsing.The charge is slow as compared to other devices of similar size battery using same charger.The screen display uses old technology, if you are getting used to IPS display you will notice the difference.Overall:The tab is good if you are tight on budget. You get what you pay. It is not good to compare this tab with other tabs of price ten times. You can use this tab for reading ebooks, emails, browsing internet, watching movie.

Apps arranged on screen automatically disappear. If you keep plugged in after 100% it starts reducing 98%97% and so on.  Usb connection to pc do not detect memory card regularly.  Do not support pendrive or data card through otg so only depend on Wifi.  When Wifi is turned on backup is less than 2 hours.  I tried first time to return but no response from amazon.  No contact option to seller. It have hotspot I don't know why because it cannot work with both functions on.Suggestion -  if you want a tab for reading books, newspaper, checking mails, and watching videos with  minimal or say no app or have budget problem (on Wifi only) then go for it but if you want to  use almost everything you can do on pc then avoid it.I am ready to help anyone wants to know anything about it before buying just write below and wait few hours.

Using it since two weeks and faced no problem.Cons:Low pixel density(167ppi) therefore text cannot be smooth and sharp, no magnetic sensor therefore no compass app works for direction, no Flash, no calling. But still I have given 5 stars for its value for money.Got from Flipkart at 3000rs -10% on sbi card. Package contains tab, charger with cable, otg cable, screen guard and manual.

You get what you pay. It is not good to compare this tab with other tabs of price ten times. You can use this tab for reading ebooks, emails, browsing internet, watching movie.

            "review_text": "Don't believe negative reviews.First read this full review,then decide to buy.I bought this tab for Rs 2800(including 500 cash back) in paytm.Design:Design is good.There are no colour options.Only you can get black colour.On the back side of the tab you can see Micromax logo and Canvas Tab Text.Overall design is good.Display:There is WSVGA TFT IPS display.I thought it would be bad.But it is very nice.Storage:There is only 8 GB internal.You get around 4 GB usable.Many people complain about storage issue.I will say solution to it later in this review.You can expand the storage by adding SD card.Performance:No hanging issues.Able to run moderate games like subway surfers,temple run and mini miltia.I played heavy games like asphalt 8,asphalt 7,modern combat 5,asphalt xtreme,nova 3 and gangster Vegas.Whatsapp is working.Just download whatsapp apk.All ran well.Browsing is smooth.It is powered by 1.3 gh mediatek quad core processor with 1 GB of ram.No other tab offers this specification at this price.Battery:Many people complain about poor battery life.Thanks to lollipop OS.Lolipop has a battery saver that on when your battery is 15%.But you can on whenever you want.You can do this by going to setting-battery-battey saver and on it.It works well.I play mini militia with friends via LAN WiFi.I had 15% battery.I turned on battery saver.I played 3 matches each lasting 15 minutes.Then the battery was 12%.Reading purposes:I also use this tablet to study.Display is good for reading.I turn on battery saver when I want to read.I also watch videos from learnnext which requires flash.I just installed dolphin browser and flash player apk and enabled flash from settings in dolphin browser.It ran well.So you can see flash content.I also have Microsoft Office Apps.Connectivity:Wifi range is very good.No SIM slot.But when your in a non wifi zone.Just turn on hotspot from your phone and connect it in your tab.Then you can browse.Camera:Camera is not great.Rear camera is 2 MP and front is a VGA Camera.You can improve picture clarity by installing Google camera.Protecting the tablet:Many find it difficult to find a case for this.Buy ACM 360 degree rotating case.There are many colour options.I have the red one.Dont buy flip covers.Their quality is not good.Buy the case from eBay cause it is just 179 rupees.Amazon adds shipping charges.Screen protector that comes with the tab is good.Rooting:You can root this tab using KingRoot.Then download Linktosd and move every user apps to SD card.I have 5 heavy games that are more than 1GB everything in SD.Game OBB and Data files save in sd card.So no storage issues.You can also install game mods such as Xmod.Overall:This tab is best for 3K.You can go blindly without thinking.Micromax has done a good job.Don't forget to hit helpful button.",
